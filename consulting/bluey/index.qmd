Does your child explain [Bluey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluey_(2018_TV_series)) episodes 
to you but you have no idea what episode they are talking about and can't handle
flicking through all 131 of them?  

Problem solved.   

This website lets you type in the vague descriptions of a small child and it will
return a mathematically ranked list of closest matching Bluey episodes.
