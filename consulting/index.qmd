I'm a specialist independent data science consultant helping science & technology start-ups and scale-ups innovate rapidly and build their data science capability. Unlike my competitors I use data
and maths, not AI or hype.  

I use cutting-edge techniques in applied mathematics, statistical modelling and data analysis to deeply understand your problems and work with your experts to add value.
