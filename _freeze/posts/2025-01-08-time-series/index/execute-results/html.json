I thought it might be worthwhile\nrecording my thoughts here in case of interest to others. \n\n- I want to highlight 3 key applications where time series analysis can add value.  \n- I want to answer three common questions I get on the topic. \n\n### What is time series data?  \n\nTime series data are data collected at specific time intervals. e.g. daily stock\nmarket prices, weekly ice cream sales, annual tourism numbers etc.   \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Half-hourly electricity demand for Victoria, Australia. Source: Australian Energy Market Operator.](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Key Applications of Time Series Data\n\n#### 1. Decomposition: Mathematically determining the components of a time series 'signal'  \n\nBelow we can decompose the long term trend or cyclicality, the seasonal periods (weekly, daily, hourly) and the remaining unexplained 'noise' so the underlying dynamics can be better understood and exploited. \n \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n \n \n#### 2. Forecasting: Predicting future values in a range of scenarios  \n\nForecasts can be applied in many ways. Statistical or machine learning models can generate estimates and realistic prediction intervals to forecast future values. We can layer extreme value analysis methods if the goal is worse-case rather than expected-case forecasting. Basic scenario driven forecasts can aid strategy development or sensitivity testing.    \n \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scenario driven forecasts can help model basic assumptions that can be tested.](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![More sophisticated distributional forecasts offer prediction intervals to better capture the undercertainty present in effective forecasting.](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n \n \n#### 3. Anomaly Detection: Finding and investigating outliers  \n\nBy understanding and decomposing the components of a time series signal we can then screen the remaining 'noise' for \nanomalous or outlying values. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### FAQ  \n\n#### Why can't we go with simple point estimates?   \n\nYou never really know what is going to happen in the future. And no model can tell you for sure either. The\nonly responsible course of action is to acknowledge there is uncertainty and quantify this through making a *distributional* forecast. \n\nRead here for more: [Level up your Forecasting Quantify uncertainty with distributional forecasts](https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-05-29-forecasting/)\n\n\n#### Why can't I just AI the shit out of this?  \n\nTime series analysis may not be as sexy as AI, but the methods behind it are robust and address\nfundamental properties that exist in data structured through time. It's easy to trip over\nyour own feet here if you aren't careful.  \n\nHere is an example of me beating Microsoft's AutoML system on a basic time series task: [Man vs Machine Learning: I went head-to-head with Microsoft’s AutoML platform in a predictive modelling challenge.](https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-06-02-man-vs-ml-20230619t002502z-001/2023-06-02-man-vs-ml/)\n\n\n#### Why bother modelling things at all?  \n\nYou don't have to. After all an entire field exists based on meaningless, post-hoc rationalisations of\nrandom fluctuations in time series data (finance). \n\nSee here: [Is the share market just random noise?](https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-01-04-randomshares/)\n\n\n## References \n\nO’Hara-Wild M, Hyndman R, Wang E, Godahewa R (2022). tsibbledata: Diverse Datasets for ‘tsibble’. https://tsibbledata.tidyverts.org/, https://github.com/tidyverts/tsibbledata/.  \n\n\n> **Looking for a data science consultant?
