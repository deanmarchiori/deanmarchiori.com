Most serious data scientists I speak to spend a lot of time worrying about [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility). From a scientific and computational perspective, this means their analysis be understood and reproduced by others and achieve the same results.\n\n### Why is this important? \n\nReproducibility enables us to understand, criticize and improve on the work of others. Without it, we are just making one flashy claim after another. \n\nWhile the promises of GenAI are many - how can it ever be used reliably in decision making if we cannot understand, reproduce, critique and improve on each other's work?\n\nThis is a challenge for Generative AI as its underlying mechanics are non-deterministic. Meaning for the exact same inputs, it will return different unpredictable outputs. \n\n> Chat Completions are non-deterministic by default (which means model outputs may differ from request to request).  \n- https://platform.openai.com/docs/advanced-usage\n\n### How can this be addressed?  \n\nMy challenge for users of GenAI is to meet the same standards as a cooking recipe book: Write down the exact steps you followed so someone else can follow them and get the same results. \n\nPractically speaking: \n\n1. If using a large language model (LLM), interact with it using code via an API. This will allow others to rerun it:\n  - With the exact same prompt\n  - With the exact same context (not whatever messed up history you have accumulated in your browser)  \n  - With the exact same model  \n2. [Set a seed.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/advanced-usage#reproducible-outputs) OpenAI (and possibly others) are introducing 'seeds' which allow you \"some control towards deterministic outputs\". \n3. Share the code and the output (if you can) so others can replicate your work. \n\n### Do seeds work? \n\nSort of. \n\nDisappointingly, this feature is only in Beta and apparently only supported for models: `gpt-4-1106-preview` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`. It also doesn't really work consistently, but I've found it does help a lot.  \n\n### Testing reproducible LLM interactions  \n\nBelow I will use the [`{ellmer}`](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/index.html) R package to generate an API call to an OpenAI model with a basic prompt: \n\n> \"Generate a short excerpt of news about a journey to Mars\"\n\nI will do this twice without setting a seed value, and then I will repeat it with a seed value set and roughly compare the output. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ellmer)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFirst I will create a function to send a basic prompt to an OpenAI LLM. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngenerate_response <- function(prompt,\n                              system_message,\n                              model,\n                              seed = NULL) {\n    print(\"LLM RESPONSE ==========================\")\n    chat <- ellmer::chat_openai(\n        model = model,\n        system_prompt = system_message,\n        turns = NULL,\n        seed = seed,\n        echo = \"text\"\n    )\n    chat$chat(prompt)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nI will run this twice with no seed value. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnoseed <- replicate(n = 2, {\n    generate_response(\n        system_message = \"You are a helpful assistant.\",\n        prompt = \"Generate a short excerpt of news about a journey to Mars\",\n        model = \"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106\",\n        seed = NULL\n    )\n})\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\n[1] \"LLM RESPONSE ==========================\"\n\"Earlier today, the Mars One mission successfully launched its first crewed spacecraft towards the red planet. The crew of six astronauts will \nembark on a historic journey, with the goal of establishing a permanent human settlement on Mars. The mission, expected to take approximately \nnine months, marks a significant milestone in space exploration and is sure to captivate the imagination of people around the world. Stay tuned \nfor updates on this exciting journey to the final frontier.\"\n[1] \"LLM RESPONSE ==========================\"\n\"NASA's Perseverance rover successfully landed on Mars today, marking a major milestone in the exploration of the red planet. The rover will \nconduct crucial experiments and collect samples to search for signs of ancient life and pave the way for future human missions. This historic \njourney to Mars offers hope for new discoveries and advancements in space exploration.\"\n```\n\nUsing [Jaccaard similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) this has a similarity value of: \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n```\n[1] 0.2588235\n```\n\nNow we repeat with with a random seed value chosen: \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwithseed <- replicate(n = 2, {\n    generate_response(\n        system_message = \"You are a helpful assistant.\",\n        prompt = \"Generate a short excerpt of news about a journey to Mars\",\n        model = \"gpt-3.5-turbo-1106\",\n        seed = 12345\n    )\n})\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\n[1] \"LLM RESPONSE ==========================\"\n\"NASA's Perseverance rover successfully landed on the surface of Mars today, marking a significant milestone in the mission to search for signs \nof ancient life on the red planet. The journey, which began seven months ago, culminated in a nail-biting descent and landing in the Jezero \nCrater. Scientists and engineers are now eagerly awaiting the first images and data from the mission, which aims to pave the way for future human\nexploration of Mars.\"\n[1] \"LLM RESPONSE ==========================\"\n\"NASA's Perseverance rover successfully landed on the surface of Mars today, marking a significant milestone in the mission to search for signs \nof ancient life on the red planet.

Making these workflow changes I think will go a long way to making GenAI outputs more transperent and allow robust discussions around how they work and how they can be used to help decision making. \n\nNote: A more rigourous test with better similirty measurement (using embeddings) of this is done in this post: [https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/reproducible_outputs_with_the_seed_parameter](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/reproducible_outputs_with_the_seed_parameter)\n\n\n> **Looking for a data science consultant?
