## Abstract 

Joel and Emily are back for another season! Today they had a chat with Statistician and Senior Data Scientist, Dean Marchiori about checking in with your ego, the importance of feedback and how he leads the data science team for an Australian energy utility where his work focuses on modelling bushfire and vegetation risk on the electricity network. In 2019, he was named one of the top 10 analytics leaders in Australia by the Institute of Analytics Professionals of Australia.

This is Keeping Up With Data, the podcast that keeps data enthusiasts up to speed with what is happening in the world of data. We bring in the leading minds from the data industry to talk all things career, news, embarrassing stories, failures and successes.
