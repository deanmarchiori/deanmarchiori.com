:::{#hero-heading}
I'm a specialist independent data science consultant helping science & technology teams innovate faster with data and maths. Not hype. I work with clients on complex problems across applied mathematics, statistical modelling, data analysis & machine learning.  

If you are interested in hiring me for a project get in touch: [dean@wavedatalabs.com.au](mailto:dean@wavedatalabs.com.au)

## Bio  

Dean Marchiori is a statistician and founder of [Wave Data Labs](https://www.wavedatalabs.com.au/) an independent data science consulting practice. Dean's career started in equities and derivatives trading in the aftermath of the GFC before moving on to establish and lead high performance data science teams. His areas of specialisation are in time series modelling & anomaly detection, geospatial analytics, unsupervised machine learning and the R programming language. He is currently co-chair of the Statistical Society of Australia‚Äôs section for [statistical computing and visualisation](https://statsoc.org.au/Statistical-Computing-and-Visualisation-Section) and chair of the SSA working group for data science accreditation. Dean obtained his Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with University Medal from Charles Sturt University. He also holds a Master of Applied Finance degree, and a Master of Applied Statistics from Macquarie University where he was awarded the Julian Leslie Prize and served as a sessional teaching academic in the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Dean holds the [Accredited Statistician (AStat)](https://statsoc.org.au/Professional-accreditation) qualification from the Statistical Society of Australia and was named one of the top 10 analytics professionals in Australia by the [Institute of Analytics Professionals of Australia (IAPA)](https://www.iapa.org.au/).   

## [Consulting](consulting/) 

If you are interested in my work you can read some case studies, or see what my clients have to say about working with me on my [consulting page](consulting/index.qmd). Below are some recent projects delivered.

- üïµ [**Anomaly detection and cluster analysis for financial crime detection:**](consulting/2024-01-01-service-2/) I built an automated system to detect suspicious companies and complex shell relationships. 
- üî• [**Australian Bushfire Risk Analysis & Mapping:**](consulting/2024-01-01-service-1/) This interactive analysis was the first of its kind to highlight bushfire planning risk for the entire Australian mainland and recieved nationwide media coverage.   
- ü¶ü [**Data Systems and Analytics for Vector-Borne Disease Threat Reduction:**](consulting/2024-10-11-eco/) I partnered with EcoHealth Alliance on a major scientific research project focused on two WHO priority zoonoses, Rift Valley fever virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus.
- üë∂ [**Analysis and mapping of access to Assisted Reproductive Technologies:**](consulting/2024-01-01-service-4/) Did you know over half a million Australians live more than 240km from an Assisted reproductive technology clinic and would likely have to sleep nearby in order to visit.  


## [Blog](posts/)  

I occassionally write [blog posts](/posts/) about data and statistics. Some of my greatest hits are below:  

- üåè [**Geolocating Sydney‚Äôs weirdest property:**](posts/2023-09-17-geolocating/) Using Open Street Map and R to geolocate a tweet of Sydney's strangest house.
