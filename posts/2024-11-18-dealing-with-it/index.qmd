> No plan survives first contact with IT  

In most organisations the single biggest challenge you will face 
as a data scientist is dealing with IT (Information Technology / Technical Support) to support and enable your data science workflows in Production. 

Why?  

It's not really anyone's fault, it's just a lack of alignment. 

IT teams don't care heaps about enabling 1% of users to run wild 
with Open Source technology or free software or weird programming languages. 

They care about managing risk. They want to enable 99% of users to do their job safely and
productively without interruption. They want you to succeed, but they deliberately want 
friction in the change management process to reduce the risk of breaking changes.  

## Tips to getting stuff done with IT  

1. **Have empathy**: Understand what their role is. Learn how little you matter to them. Figure
out what would make them look good. Find your common enemies and work together. Don't get 
frustrated at them. It's a feature not a bug. You just want different things. You have no idea the shit they have to deal with every day.   

2. **Political alignment**: You can go into battle with some poor IT manager with
a million bigger fish to fry, or you can try to influence your own manager. They
are actually motivated to ensure your success and will be able to influence IT 
in a more effective way on your behalf. 

3. **Find supporters**: Okay sometimes you just need a favour. Find out who likes you
and if they are willing to give you a hand now and then. Reward generously with 
coffee and thanks. Swing by their desk, ask about cricket or what flavour of
Linux they are running at home.

4. **Find (safe) workarounds**: There are areas of grey where policy meets reality. Live
in those areas. IT staff are smart technologists, they exploit this grey area too. Just
do it ethically. If you org has actively blocked something and have no risk appetite to do something,
then don't bypass it. Otherwise, sometimes it's better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission. 


5. **Buy commercially licensed software**: If you go to your IT manager with arguments 
like: R/python is free, its open source, it wont cost anything, I can manage it myself, 
everyone cool on the Internet is using it, SAS/STATA are crap - then you wont get far. 
IT don't care about free and open source. They want to know the software is supported so they can get help
when inevitably users call them for help. They want to know the legal terms and 
conditions to keep legal happy. They want to ensure security vulnerabilities
are patched (not by you). They want to know how it will integrate with the
enterprise identity management solution. How will users be managed and authorised. 
They want to manage software in-line with the other billion apps they support and 
not by some exception because of some nerdy business user (you). Consider buying commercially licensed software like [Posit Connect or Workbench](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/). All of these problems go away and its just another piece of software. The argument then just devolves into who pays. And guess what? Everyone in a big organisation has it in their head that software licences are expensive so the sticker price won't really surprise anyone. 


**Bonus tip: Share success**: Don't be a jerk and twist arms in other departments and get what you want then
take all the credit yourself. Share success. Present to your IT team's monthly meetings, 
include them in yours. Develop a 'partnership'. They might have to be the 'gatekeepers'
but they work for the same company because they want to make an impact too. So recognise 
it and appreciate it. You can't do impactful work without them.
