Binomial proportion confidence intervals are often employed when attempting to 
perform tests for significance, or sample size calculations around sample
measurements resulting from a [Bernoulli process.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process)

The typical choice when calculating binomial proportion confidence intervals is the 
asymptotic, or normally approximated 'Wald' interval where success probability
is measured by:

$$
\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$  

In many settings, such as marketing analytics or manufacturing processes the 
sample proportion is close to 0 or 1. Evaluating asymptotic confidence intervals
near these boundary conditions will lead to underestimation of the error, and in some
cases producing an interval outside $[0, 1]$. 

Fortunately other methods exist, such as Wilson's score interval, exact methods and Bayesian
approaches. The recommendation here is to examine the probability coverage and explore alternative
methods for sample size and CI calculation, especially when the parameter is
near the boundary conditions, or in cases of very small n.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(binom)
library(tidyverse)

n <- 50
p <- c(0.01, 0.5, 0.99)
```

```{r}
x <- purrr::map_df(p, .f =  ~binom.confint(x = n * .x, n = n, methods = 'all'))
```

```{r}
ggplot(x, aes(colour = factor(x))) +
  geom_point(aes(mean, method), show.legend = F) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper, y = method), show.legend = F) +
  geom_vline(xintercept =  c(0, 1), lty = 2, col = "grey") +
  facet_wrap(~(x*2/100)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "A variety of binomial confidence interval methods for p = 0.01, 0.5 & 0.99",
       subtitle = "Note unusual behaviour near 0.01 and 0.99")
```

```{r}
cov <- purrr::map_df(p, ~binom.coverage(.x, n, conf.level = 0.95, method = "all"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(cov, aes(colour = factor(p))) +
  geom_point(aes(coverage, method), show.legend = F) +
  geom_vline(xintercept =  0.95, lty = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~(p)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Probability coverage for a variety of binomial confidence interval methods",
       subtitle = "Reference line at 0.95 coverage")
```
