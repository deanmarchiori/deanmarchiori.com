Earlier in my career, in the afternath of the GFC I worked as trader for an online share trading platform. 
Everyday I would get blasted with a firehose of emotion from investors. People day-trading
on their accounts, needing help placing exotic trades or dealing during volatile 
markets.   

It's easy to get swept up in the excitement. Sweating on every tick of
the market. Listening to the live market news and updates, trying to time it just right.  

I had a holiday booked with my partner, so I took a couple of weeks off and didn't look at the markets. When I returned, it was like I never left. Everyone was still on the same hamster wheel. The market had moved, but it was kind of the same. 

Having formal mathematics training lent me some perspective. It reminded me of the famous
fractal pattern popularised by Benoit Mandelbrot where certain geometric shapes look
similar to themselves as you continually zoom in (a process known as self-similarity[^1]).

It got me thinking, was this all just random noise. Was this all just a giant illusion based
on psychology, sales targets and the need to fill column inches?  

I recently completed Michael Kemp's excellent book *The Ulysses Contract: How to never worry about the share market again.*[^2]  

Kemp breaks down common myths around 'authority' in financial markets and the tendancy for 
humans to fall prey to cognitive biases and essentially forgetting history when it
comes to the markets. I agreed with nearly every word in the book. Although admitedly, 
I did blush at how my attitudes differed when I was a freshly minted finance 
graduate. 

Author and interesting person Nassim Nicholas Taleb also writes about this in his 2001
classic *Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets.*[^3]. 
Despite his writing style being extrememly abrasive, the underlying points are 
compelling. Are we all blinded by randomness? Commentating, analysing and taking
credit for what is essentially random noise happening *to* us?  


## A random market?   

**It got me thinking, could the average punter tell the difference
between the stock market and random noise?**  

To test this, I simulated a type of data called a 'random walk'. A random walk
is a type of mathematical, time-series model. It describes a process of sequential
observations (say, daily share prices). Each day's share price is simulated by taking 
yesterday's price and just adding randomly generated 'noise'. It doesn't try to emulate the shape
or style of share market. It's really dumb. It just takes the price one day 
and either adds or subtracts a small random amount (of normally distributed noise).  

The funny thing about this model is it often contains[^4]:

- long periods of apparent trends up or down
- sudden and unpredictable changes in direction.  

Sound like the share market anyone??  


This can be written as:

$$
y_t = y_{t-1} + e_t
$$
Really, this is just a special case of a class of time-series models called ARIMA models. 
In particular it is an Autoregressive model, that is, a model that is formed from linear combination of previous values. 

$$
y_t = c + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \phi_2 y_{t-2} + ... + \phi_p y_{t-p} + e_t 
$$
Where we set just one term $\phi_1 = 1$, $c = 0$ and specify $e_t \sim N(0, s)$

## The Test  

I have simulated 1000 values of a random walk (AR(1)) model and placed this next to 
1000 recent observations of a randomly selected Australian stock's daily closing price.   

Can you tell which is which?  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(123)

sim <- tibble(
  idx = 1:1000,
  y = arima.sim(
    n = 999,
    model = list(order = c(0, 1, 0)),
    rand.gen = rnorm,
    sd = 0.8
  ),
  type = "A"
)

stock <- read_csv(here::here("posts/2024-01-04-randomshares/data/BHP.AX.csv")) |>
  slice(8001:9000) |> # roughly last 1000 obs
  mutate(
    y  = parse_number(Close),
    y = y - y[1], # normalising to start at zero like the sim
    idx = 1:1000,
    type = "B"
  ) |>
  select(idx, y, type)

out <- bind_rows(sim, stock)

ggplot(out, aes(idx, y)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap( ~ type) +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title = "Which chart represents real share prices?",
       subtitle = "The other is just a random walk simulation",
       x = '', y = '')

```

## So are the markets actually random?  

I don't really know. In the short term, it does *look* random. In the long term, the Australian share market has continued to exhibit long term growth. This doesn't mean its  dynamics aren't driven my a random walk, after all these models can incorporate drift. 

There is even a formal theory in finance called the Random Walk hypothesis[^5] in which some financial
heavyweights have argued that stock prices evolve based on a random walk process and are thus - **unpredictable.**  

Randomness is very tricky - the implication here isn't that the markets are meaningless or the 
underlying dynamics are random or that you cant make money. 

Rather, we can think of stock prices being *modelled* well by a random
walk process. So what you can do about a process that is modelled well by a random walk? 

You can start by calling bullshit on attempts to explain or predict short term price fluctuations. Even 
if they sound confident and wear a suit.
