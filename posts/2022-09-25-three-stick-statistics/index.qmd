When I was a teenager I was very popular among my peers, which is why I spent every
second Saturday playing in a retiree's social golf club.  For each event we would travel
via air-conditioned coach to a local public golf course and play some sort of themed
game. The most exciting event was the *three stick event*. This game requires 
players to pick just **three** golf clubs out of their bag (plus a putter) to play their entire round (you can take up to 14 clubs
on a normal round).  

So which three clubs do you pick? 

This was easy for me as I could only reliably hit two clubs: the five iron and the
seven iron. I usually included a driver so as not be mocked by the septuagenarians 
at the par-5 tees. 

I also have an embarrassingly crap collection of golf clubs as many have been sent
to an early retirement in water features.

However, many friends who now play golf have a bewildering selection
of exotic clubs from hybrid driving irons to 60-degree lob-wedges. 

It seems like in there is always some new technology or method to master in 
data science broadly. This is interesting, but also exhausting and fills me with
existential dread that I am becoming irrelevant. 

It got me thinking, if you had to play statistics (or data science) for the rest of your
career with just three algorithms/models, what would they be?  

## My three sticks:

1. **Random Forest**: Uncontroversial ensemble method that can quickly get a performance
ceiling with minimal fuss. It lacks some interpretability, but
I'll keep it in my bag for when I want to squeeze as much AUC as I can in a 
prediction setting. 

2. **Generalised Additive Model (GAM)**: You could argue this is quite broad, but that's okay. 
I've had good luck with GAMs as they provide a solid statistical approach that I am 
comfortable with, along with the flexibility of using smooths for non-linear terms that
seems to be a key feature in the problems I have to solve. If I had to only pick one club
this would probably be it. 

3. **k-medoids clustering:** Clustering methods are a great third club to have in your bag. 
They solve a different problem to the modelling tasks above and provide a good hedge for those 
unsupervised tasks that come along fairly regularly. While everyone knows k-means, I enjoy
the increased interpretation of k-medoids as the cluster centers are always one of the 
input data points. It also allows for more generalised distance methods (such as Gower's 
distance) which I have found useful for mixed data types. 

We can include `lm()` as the default putter you get for free. 

Which three clubs would you pick in your bag?
