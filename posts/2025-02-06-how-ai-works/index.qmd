Do you ever wake up at night, slightly disoriented, breathless, wondering how artificial
neaural nets are able to optimise weights without encountering discontinutities?  

Do you ever stare at your boss's mouth while it's moving but you can't hear a word they
are saying because you are realise the words we use are just an artibrary token system
that doesn't make much sense until we use our little monkey mouths to make sounds. 

Well, regardless here are some enjoyable videos that nicely explain the underlying mathematical
concepts and intuition behind common AI models like neural nets and LLM's. 

Now you too can be an AI expert without the interminable tedium of doing a mathematics 
or computer science degree. 

## If you want some intuition behing the 'atomic' building blocks of AI  

This is a cute video that build the intuition behind neural nets and a little bit
on underlying maths, but still mercifully short.

## If you like a litte math and code  

This is a old-ish series on hand-rolling a neural net program in python, which
is cool, but assumes a fair bit of basic maths knowledge. But bonus points for
the episodes also being short.

## If you are super keen and have a spare 3 hours  

This is a slog, but it's very well explained by a real expert, in very accessible language.
