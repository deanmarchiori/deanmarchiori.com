<p>Earlier this year I was fortunate enough to work with EcoHealth Alliance on a major project focused on two WHO priority zoonoses, Rift Valley fever virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. Over a 10 year period, research teams sampled over 800 people and livestock, sampled over 300 rodents, and conducted ecological site characterizations at 150 sites in each Tanzania and South Africa.</p>
<p>To integrate data from disparate datasets we developed a novel R pipeline to standardize data cleaning, quality control and integration following reproducible science principals. This was one of the first projects of this scale that I have seen using so many tools that align to current industry best practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version controlled code in Github with strict code review</li>
<li>Full CI/CD automation with Github Actions<br>
</li>
<li><code>{targets}</code> as a pipeline tool<br>
</li>
<li>R package to store and document all functions<br>
</li>
<li><code>{renv}</code> for package dependency management<br>
</li>
<li>Proper encrypted environment files for all credentials</li>
</ul>
<p>A common deterrent I hear from begginers around using tools to aid reproducility often center around the barriers to entry. They are seen as adding complexity and overhead into the process. Which they do (on small projects), but as projects become more and more complex, the benefits quickly outweigh the costs.</p>
<p>An overview of this project was given as a poster at the recent 8th World One Health Congress in Cape Town</p>

  <title>Data Science Workflows: Choosing the Right One</title>
  <dc:creator>Dean Marchiori</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-10-08-whichworkflow/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In <a href="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/">previous posts</a> I have discussed frameworks for thinking about data science projects. When it comes to actually writing R code, there are a number of <em>coding</em> workflows you can adopt to get the work done. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monolithic Notebook (RMarkdown, Quarto)</li>
<li>Directory structure with <code>run.R</code> control scripts (e.g.&nbsp;ProjectTemplate)</li>
<li>Opinionated pipeline tools (<code>{targets}</code>, <code>{drake}</code> etc)<br>
</li>
<li>R Package</li>
</ul>
<p>So which R workflow should you use?</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is not a straightforward decision. For quick experimental code you are unlikely to create a new R package. For a complex production deployed model, you really don’t want all your code in one giant R script. It’s hard to know ahead of time what to do and where on this spectrum you will end up.</p>
<p>In my view, picking the correct workflow needs to align the project goals and scope. Often this choice can evolve throughout the project.</p>
<section id="an-evolution" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-evolution">An evolution</h3>
<p>A concept or idea might be tested in a single R script, like how you would use the back of a napkin for an idea.</p>
<p>Next you might break this down into chunks and add some prose, heading and plots so you can share and have other understand it.</p>
<p>Next you might refactor the messy code into functions to better control the flow and the improve development practices. These functions can be documented and unit tested once you know you want to rely on them.</p>
<p>To orchestrate the running and dependency structure to avoid re-running slow and complex code you may use the <code>{targets}</code> package.</p>
<p>Finally to re-use, share and improve on the functions you might spin these out into their own R package!</p>
</section>
<section id="repro-retro" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="repro-retro">REPRO-RETRO</h3>
<p>A few years back I gave a short talk at the <a href="https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-global-2021/">rstudio::global</a> conference. I talked about how you might want to weight and prioritise the elements of your analysis to make an appropriate choice.</p>
<p>I framed this through the concept of a reproducibility-retrospective (repro-retro)</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

  <title>Data Science Workflows: Inner Loop vs Outer Loop</title>
  <dc:creator>Dean Marchiori</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-10-04-innerloop/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In a <a href="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-09-26-crispdm/">previous post</a> I discussed the charming nostalgia of CRISP-DM as a data analysis workflow choice.</p>
<p>A modern limitation of this model is how it handles the <em>Deployment</em> step. In the olden days this was usually some form of static report to a client. It’s a loaded topic now with deployment usually having something to do with giving money to AWS/MSFT or a battle to the death with your IT department.</p>
<p>In a practical sense this usually means rigging up an endpoint for your analysis like an API, shiny app, dashboard or similar. Managing this process is rapidly becoming it’s own sub-speciality, fashionably called MLOps.</p>
<p>A useful way to think about this is in terms of <strong>Inner Loop vs Outer Loop</strong> thinking. I first observed this (for better or worse) in Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/Azure/mlops-v2/blob/main/documentation/architecture/classical.md">Azure Machine Learning Classical ML Architecture</a>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-10-04-innerloop/arch.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Source: Microsoft MLOps Accelerator. MIT Licence</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The <strong>Inner Loop</strong> (Item 3 in the above diagram) is everything in CRISP-DM <em>except</em> ‘Deployment’. It covers the whole data identification, EDA and modelling processes. For lack of a better term I usually call this ‘experimental’ code. It’s usually circular, iterative and experimental in nature.</p>
<p>At some point you will be happy with an output and want to push it out into the world. This is the <strong>Outer Loop</strong> (Item 5 in the diagram). It’s its own process and involves more engineer-y tasks like provisioning infrastructure, testing &amp; deployment (usually using some CI/CD pipeline) versioning your model and monitoring for drift, quality etc.</p>
<p>I see two big issues with this in practice:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Analysts do the inner loop, declare victory and have no awareness or interest managing the outer loop. This means the analyst needs to re-run the model on their laptop every month and email the results to Kevin, or some such process. Heaven forbid they live in an area of dense, fast moving buses.</p></li>
<li><p>The analysts want to more formally deploy their models but don’t have the skills, support or permission. In the end, everything gets shoehorned into a PowerBI dashboard or some half-way solution.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My proposed solutions to this in ascending order of complexity are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start implementing more robust controls over how you save, version, monitor and document the outputs of your analysis - including models.</li>
</ol>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
MLOps in R
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>If you are an R programmer, the tidymodels team at Posit have recently plugged this gaping hole with the <code>{vetiver}</code> package. <a href="https://vetiver.posit.co/">https://vetiver.posit.co/</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Get some really light-weight deployment solution to get off the ground like <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/">shinyapps.io</a> or a development/sandpit Virtual Machine (in a sensible network location) to throw stuff up on manually and build some goodwill with IT.</p></li>
<li><p>Move to a more commercially palatable ‘walled-garden’ solution like <a href="https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/">Posit Connect</a>. This strikes a nice balance between being licensed, managed software and giving analysts autonomy in what and how they deploy.</p></li>
<li><p>Utilize your existing cloud providers ML Ops solutions to automate the build and deployment from your version control system - just be careful, this is a slippery slope in terms of complexity and you don’t need to go all-in. This typically keeps IT happy in a heavily regulated environment due to the native integration of network/cloud security protocols.</p></li>

  <title>Data Science Workflows: CRISP-DM</title>
  <dc:creator>Dean Marchiori</dc:creator>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining">cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM)</a> is a process model and framework for carrying out data mining projects.</p>
<p>‘Data mining’ is quite a funny term and will instantly carbon-date you if you use it. It very much of a late 90’s era. If you were around then your WFH setup probably looked like this. So good.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Still room for a CD burner</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Nostalgia aside, it remains a popular choice for contemporary data analysis workflows. In my practice I use a version of it for almost every project. I’m not going to bother doing a deep dive (although <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/~danilo.montesi/CBD/Beatriz/10.1.1.198.5133.pdf">here</a> is a nice overview) into each step, as honestly I don’t think any framework should be rigidly adopted, but here is the thrust of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>You start with <em>Business Understanding</em> and <em>Data Understanding</em> as a simultaneous, iterative step. Can’t do one without the other.</li>
<li>Eventually you want to do some <em>Modeling</em> which will require <em>Data Preparation</em> and feature engineering etc.</li>
<li>Once you have some results you want to <em>Evaluate</em> they solve the business problem</li>
<li>Eventually you want to <em>Deploy</em> something.</li>
<li>There is also a ‘meta’ step of this whole thing not being just a one-shot framework and you may need to cycle through it a few times at different levels of detail.</li>
</ul>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>I like it, but want to focus on some of the more important insights I have found in practice:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You don’t have to (and shouldn’t) do the steps in a rigid order. It’s just a framework.</li>
<li>Don’t skimp on <em>Business Understanding</em> and <em>Data Understanding</em>. I know you want to start modelling straight away, just slow down cowboy.<br>
</li>
<li>Evaluation doesnt mean model-evaluation (like ROC, AIC etc). That is done in the ‘Modelling’ step. Here it means going back to the business owner or expert and stress-testing the results to see if it solves the problem and makes real-world sense.</li>
<li>A key reason I use this is to show your stakeholder that you have <em>a process</em> to follow. This will give everyone confidence.</li>
<li>It’s a great tool to facilitate status and project updates. i.e.&nbsp;We are here, and next we are moving in this direction.<br>
</li>
<li>That said, if you try to integrate this into waterfall or scrum project management frameworks you will find it a little unsatisfying, as it is recognised as not a real project management framework.</li>
<li>For smaller exploratory or discovery projects I tend to use these 6 phases as ‘stages’ of a project, which makes it easier to draw up a proposal and quote a job. In practice for larger projects you do need to be more iterative and cycle through 2 or three times, so be careful not to timebox each step unless you know you are just going around one time.<br>
</li>
<li>The deployment phase is a little tricky. It used to mean writing a paper or report. Now this is more of a full-blooded discipline in a tech sense. This is where is see the biggest modern drawback: Reconciling analysis work with product development and deployment.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a future post I will discuss another framework on how to use CRISP-DM in the context of building and shipping something to production.</p>
<p>So should you use it? Yes. It’s great, and it’s changed my analysis projects profoundly. Rather than whipping off the curtain at the ‘results’ presentation and hear everyone in the room gulp at the same time, you manage the flow of results throughout the process so there are no surprises and its truly more collaborative.</p>

  <title>Is ChatGPT is a bullshit machine?</title>
  <dc:creator>Dean Marchiori</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-06-21-llm-bs/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A recent paper published in ‘Ethics and Information Technology’ titled <em>ChatGPT is bullshit</em> <sup>1</sup> is fast becoming one of my favorite papers. Not least because it uses the word bullshit 165 times.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-06-21-llm-bs/featured.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The hype surrounding the use of Large Language Models (LLM’s) such as ChatGPT, Bard, Llama, Claude etc has been inescapable lately.</p>
<p>I have become increasingly concerned with the general willingness to accept that these systems are generating knowledge, truth and reason.</p>
<p>Here is the key message:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They are bullshit machines.<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>They have no regard or intention to convey truth.</li>
<li>They are programmed to sound plausible.</li>
<li>There are loads of interesting use-cases when deployed properly but;</li>
<li>You (the human) need to take responsiblity for its use and outputs.</li>
</ol>
<p>ChatGPT-like models are more kindly described as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot">stochastic parrots</a><sup>3</sup>. As the authors of the above paper put it “This means that their primary goal, insofar as they have one, is to produce human-like text. They do so by estimating the likelihood that a particular word will appear next, given the text that has come before.”</p>
<p>They are not searching for truth, they are not concerned with the truthyness of their statements. They just want to give a plausible looking response. Without any regard for if it’s right.</p>
<p>We often hear about these models ‘hallucinating’ as if its an occassional abberation from its otherwise sensical answers. But this is wrong. It’s a poor metaphor that attempts to anthropomorphize the technology. It’s something that I’ve always hated about recent AI technology. Its need to be ‘human-like’.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The problem here isn’t that large language models hallucinate, lie, or misrepresent the world in some way. It’s that they are not designed to represent the world at all; instead, they are designed to convey convincing lines of text.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason so many are fooled by the randomness is that humans are, on average more likely to be right than wrong. So a model driven emulation will often be correct. These applications also act as ‘agent-like’ systems when in fact they don’t have agency or cognitive reasoning - but they are designed to be interacted with like they do.</p>
<p>So should you use this type of AI? Sure, but consider where it’s appropriate.</p>
<p>The benefits in generative and creative applications are impressive and exciting. Applications in pattern recognition, and information retrieval are exciting new ways to think about our relationship with computers.</p>
<p>To do nothing and be a luddite would be a mistake. We need more advanced use of algorithmic and model based decisions, but they need to be applied and built in consultation with experts.</p>
<p>To surrender your analytical and cognitive reasoning to AI doesn’t make you look hip and smart, it just puts the stochastic parrot on your shoulder.</p>
<p>The key here is to understand the fundamentals and take ownership and accountability for the outputs it produces.</p>

  <title>Is the share market just random noise?</title>
  <dc:creator>Dean Marchiori</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-01-04-randomshares/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Earlier in my career, in the afternath of the GFC I worked as trader for an online share trading platform. Everyday I would get blasted with a firehose of emotion from investors. People day-trading on their accounts, needing help placing exotic trades or dealing during volatile markets.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get swept up in the excitement. Sweating on every tick of the market. Listening to the live market news and updates, trying to time it just right.</p>
<p>I had a holiday booked with my partner, so I took a couple of weeks off and didn’t look at the markets. When I returned, it was like I never left. Everyone was still on the same hamster wheel. The market had moved, but it was kind of the same.</p>
<p>Having formal mathematics training lent me some perspective. It reminded me of the famous fractal pattern popularised by Benoit Mandelbrot where certain geometric shapes look similar to themselves as you continually zoom in (a process known as self-similarity<sup>1</sup>).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2024-01-04-randomshares/img/selfsim.gif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>It got me thinking, was this all just random noise. Was this all just a giant illusion based on psychology, sales targets and the need to fill column inches?</p>
<p>I recently completed Michael Kemp’s excellent book <em>The Ulysses Contract: How to never worry about the share market again.</em><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Kemp breaks down common myths around ‘authority’ in financial markets and the tendancy for humans to fall prey to cognitive biases and essentially forgetting history when it comes to the markets. I agreed with nearly every word in the book. Although admitedly, I did blush at how my attitudes differed when I was a freshly minted finance graduate.</p>
<p>Author and interesting person Nassim Nicholas Taleb also writes about this in his 2001 classic <em>Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets.</em><sup>3</sup>. Despite his writing style being extrememly abrasive, the underlying points are compelling. Are we all blinded by randomness? Commentating, analysing and taking credit for what is essentially random noise happening <em>to</em> us?</p>
<section id="a-random-market" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-random-market">A random market?</h2>
<p><strong>It got me thinking, could the average punter tell the difference between the stock market and random noise?</strong></p>
<p>To test this, I simulated a type of data called a ‘random walk’. A random walk is a type of mathematical, time-series model. It describes a process of sequential observations (say, daily share prices). Each day’s share price is simulated by taking yesterday’s price and just adding randomly generated ‘noise’. It doesn’t try to emulate the shape or style of share market. It’s really dumb. It just takes the price one day and either adds or subtracts a small random amount (of normally distributed noise).</p>
<p>The funny thing about this model is it often contains<sup>4</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>long periods of apparent trends up or down</li>
<li>sudden and unpredictable changes in direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sound like the share market anyone??</p>
<p>This can be written as:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ay_t%20=%20y_%7Bt-1%7D%20+%20e_t%0A"> Really, this is just a special case of a class of time-series models called ARIMA models. In particular it is an Autoregressive model, that is, a model that is formed from linear combination of previous values.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Ay_t%20=%20c%20+%20%5Cphi_1%20y_%7Bt-1%7D%20+%20%5Cphi_2%20y_%7Bt-2%7D%20+%20...%20+%20%5Cphi_p%20y_%7Bt-p%7D%20+%20e_t%0A"> Where we set just one term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cphi_1%20=%201">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c%20=%200"> and specify <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?e_t%20%5Csim%20N(0,%20s)"></p>
</section>
<section id="the-test" class="level2">

<p>I have simulated 1000 values of a random walk (AR(1)) model and placed this next to 1000 recent observations of a randomly selected Australian stock’s daily closing price.</p>
<p>Can you tell which is which?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-are-the-markets-actually-random">So are the markets actually random?</h2>
<p>I don’t really know. In the short term, it does <em>look</em> random. In the long term, the Australian share market has continued to exhibit long term growth. This doesn’t mean its dynamics aren’t driven my a random walk, after all these models can incorporate drift.</p>
<p>There is even a formal theory in finance called the Random Walk hypothesis<sup>5</sup> in which some financial heavyweights have argued that stock prices evolve based on a random walk process and are thus - <strong>unpredictable.</strong></p>
<p>Randomness is very tricky - the implication here isn’t that the markets are meaningless or the underlying dynamics are random or that you cant make money.</p>
<p>Rather, we can think of stock prices being <em>modelled</em> well by a random walk process. So what you can do about a process that is modelled well by a random walk?</p>
<p>You can start by calling bullshit on attempts to explain or predict short term price fluctuations. Even if they sound confident and wear a suit.</p>

  <title>Geolocating Sydney’s weirdest property</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A defiant Aussie family has refused to sell their farm-land property despite the entire neighborhood being converted into a new housing estate.</p>
<p>Is this real? Where is it? Could I geolocate it using just OSINT<sup>1</sup> techniques?… Yeah of course.</p>
<p>I have a loose theory that no matter who or where you are, there is probably sufficient data for a sufficiently motivated person to find you.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>I saw this pop up on Twitter<sup>2</sup> and other tabloid sites a while ago and thought it would be fun to try and geolocate it from the Twitter post alone.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet blockquote">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
A family in Australia has remained defiant in selling their nearly 5-acre property in the last few years as developers have been forced to build around them. Most recently, they declined a whopping $50 million offer for their home. Slap bang in the middle of a new-build… <a href="https://t.co/pULUqpe1em">pic.twitter.com/pULUqpe1em</a>

<p>The main clue we get is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>About 40 minutes from Sydney’s central core, the property offers panoramic views of the Blue Mountains.</p>

<p><em>(Actually the tweet and some articles do mention the suburb, but let’s ignore that so we don’t spoil the fun)</em></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-method">The Method</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the property is 40 minutes from Sydney and has views of the Blue Mountains, its likely to be somewhere West of the city.</li>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>We can use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osrm/index.html">{osrm}</a> package in R to construct drive time isochrones. This leverages the Open Source Routing Machine, based on Open Street Map data to calculate polygons that represent a given drive time from a set of coordinates. If we set this as 35-45 min drive time from the center of Sydney, we should get a ‘ring’ around Sydney containing the property location.</li>

  <title>Deploying Enterprise Scale AI &amp; Machine Learning Infrastucture</title>
  <dc:creator>Dean Marchiori</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Are you about to scale up your data analytics team to do more AI/ML work? Here are 5 things you need to know up front to make your life easier.</p>
<p>These are tips focused on enterprise-level organisations wanting to implement Microsoft’s <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/machine-learning">Azure Machine Learning studio</a>. But I’m sure the content translates well to other settings.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-09-11-enterprise-ml/featured.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<section id="people---process---platform-pick-any-three" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="people---process---platform-pick-any-three">1) People - Process - Platform (pick any three)</h2>
<p>Effective analytics and machine learning requires coordination of <strong>People, Process &amp; Platform</strong>. But do you need all three?</p>
<p>Yes. But you don’t need all three to get started.</p>
<p>Most Data Scientists will not care about and will not identify as owning MLOps. They want to lead experimentation and innovation, not building production-grade ML pipelines. You will either have to:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Find an internal champion to lead this and train others.</li>
<li>Hire an ML engineer if you have enough work to keep them busy (A recent ML Engineer job ad I saw was around $650k, so bear that in mind).<br>
</li>
<li>Work with a specialist partner / consultant to fill this gap and support your teams doing what they are good at.</li>
</ol>
<p>Converting experimental analytics POCs into robust MLOps-style pipelines is not trivial. It takes real, behind the scenes work which is kind of thankless. But sometimes you need to eat your vegetables and do this. Ensuring you have a well crafted process for governing how, when and why MLOps should exist will help secure the time, funding and social capital you need.</p>
</section>
<section id="dont-overlook-security" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dont-overlook-security">2) Don’t overlook security</h2>
<p>Want to know where you are going to face challenges and delays implementing an AI/Ml platform?</p>
<p>Wonder no more: Network Security.</p>
<p>Azure ML Studio (and any ML platform) will require serious planning around network architecture and security, and for good reason. It’s not as scary as it sounds, but it does require expertise. You need to have strong representation on your project from a decision maker and a ‘doer’ in network security. If these people aren’t inside the tent with you, your project will grind to a halt.</p>
</section>
<section id="think-about-dev-work-not-just-mlops" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="think-about-dev-work-not-just-mlops">3) Think about dev work, not just MLOps</h2>
<p>If we are being honest, not many organisations are ready for scalable, reproducible, high performance ML deployments. But almost all orgs are building toward this in the next 5 years. So what’s most useful in the here and now?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Easy to access online notebooks with various kernels</li>
<li>Click of a button scalable compute, without fussing about with the infra layer</li>
<li>AutoML tools to find performance ceilings and explore the solution space of new problems</li>
</ol>
<p>Want to get your data scientist on board? Tell them they wont have to run jobs on their laptops overnight anymore.</p>
</section>
<section id="its-python-heavy-sorry-r-users" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="its-python-heavy-sorry-r-users">4) It’s Python heavy (sorry R users)</h2>
<p>There a lot to complain about if you are an R user. Azure ML studio is decidedly a Python oriented tool. While admittedly, most high-level AI development work is in Python, in reality a lot of so called “ML” projects are classical statistical models anyway. There are nice tools within R ecosystem for <a href="https://putrinprod.com/">putting R in prod</a>. However if you work in an enterprise setting, you may need to deploy your models on the chosen enterprise analytics platform. This is not ideal for R users, but hopefully in a future post I can show you how to have the best of both worlds.</p>
</section>
<section id="its-not-an-etl-environment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="its-not-an-etl-environment">5) Its not an ETL environment</h2>
<p>Like any tool its only good for what it’s good for. When we think of true end-to-end machine learning projects there are steps in that process that are better fit in other tools. A common suspect here is the data import and processing. It’s nice to coordinate ML deployments with your data engineering teams to ensure you are using the right tools for the right jobs.</p>

  <title>Three Questions to Ask Your Data Scientist</title>
  <dc:creator>Dean Marchiori</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-07-12-three-questions/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>If you have hired a data scientist or run a team of data people, you may not be an expert yourself (that’s why you hired an expert, right?). So how do you know you are receiving a quality predictive model and not some BS that was thrown carelessly at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box">black-box</a> machine learning model.</p>
<p>The consequences of poorly built statistical models are not trivial. In 2015, Amazon realized its ‘AI recruiting tool’ didn’t like women<sup>1</sup>. In the US, facial recognition models used by police were found to have biases that more commonly misidentified underrepresented communities.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>So what can you do about it?</p>
<section id="three-questions-you-can-ask-your-data-scientist" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="three-questions-you-can-ask-your-data-scientist">Three questions you can ask your data scientist</h2>
<section id="how-could-the-model-be-unfair" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-could-the-model-be-unfair">1. How could the model be unfair?</h3>
<ul>
<li>What training data was used, and how was this collected?</li>
<li>Could certain sub-populations be over or under-represented in this data?</li>
<li>Have customer details been anonymised?<br>
</li>
<li>Are sensitive features used in the model training (race, religion, gender, political preferences).</li>
</ul>
<p>Algorithmic unfairness and biases are already huge issues which are only getting worse. Further reading on this topic is covered by Cathy O’Neil’s excellent book <em>Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy</em><sup>3</sup>.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-assumptions-does-the-model-make-and-how-have-these-been-tested" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-assumptions-does-the-model-make-and-how-have-these-been-tested">2. What assumptions does the model make, and how have these been tested?</h3>
<p>All statistical models have assumptions that are made in order for the math to work out. Models are intended to be simplified representations of reality, deliberately so statisticians can exploit properties like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">Central Limit Theorem</a> to help make inferences. For example the assumptions behind a simple linear regression include:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The response variable can be expressed as a linear combination of the predictors.<br>
</li>
<li>The variance of the error terms is homoscedastic (has constant variance).<br>
</li>
<li>The errors in the response are independent.</li>
</ol>
<p>In many cases these can be checked using standard diagnostics tests and plots. However in most cases it requires more in depth domain knowledge and context.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-accurate-is-the-model" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-accurate-is-the-model">3. How accurate is the model?</h3>
<p>Ever been told a model is 99% accurate? I’d be very worried if you had. Be skeptical of very high performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2236/">xkcd.com</a> highlight this well with their ‘Is it Christmas?’ predictive model.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_christmas.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ul>
<li><p>On what data has the model been tested? Is it a completely independent test set? Was there any leakage from the training data? Was the feature engineering done before or after the training/test split (hint: it usually needs to be after).</p></li>
<li><p>If your model is a binary classification model, you should know what the ‘null model’ is and whether it outperforms this.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Accuracy</em> is just one measure and is the proportion of correct classifications (both positive and negative class) but you may have different tolerance for misclassifications of each class. For example, you might be predicting the presence of a disease from a test. If you make a false positive, will the risk of side-effects or cost outweigh the risk the making a false negative and having the patient get sicker or die? It’s tricky.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to accuracy ask for the following metrics, along with an explanation of what they mean.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity / Recall</li>
<li>Specificity</li>
<li>Precision / Positive Predictive Value</li>
<li>Negative Predictive Value</li>
<li>ROC AUC</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ask for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix">confusion matrix</a>. All of the above measures (except ROC) can be calculated from the confusion matrix. Despite its name, it will be instantly clear where the model is working well versus not.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask what cut-off or threshold was used to make the predicted classifications. Many classification models return conditional class probabilities, which need to be converted into labels such as (Yes/No, Cancer/Not Cancer, Churn/Not Churn). A default value is to use a 0.5 probability for the crisp cutoff, but it’s subjective and depends on the desired trade off in sensitivity / specificity as well as other complicated factors like training class imbalance.</p></li>
</ul>

  <title>Why your data science projects are failing</title>

<p>The most undervalued skill in delivering value with data science teams is picking projects that are likely to succeed. There is no shortcut - it takes years of hard earned experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A number that seems to be floating around is 80% of data science projects will FAIL. Ouch.</p>
<p>Many of these types of numbers are ‘predictions’ from consultancies who stand to benefit from making big claims.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Through 2022, only 20% of analytic insights will deliver business outcomes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2019/01/03/our-top-data-and-analytics-predicts-for-2019/">https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2019/01/03/our-top-data-and-analytics-predicts-for-2019/</a></p>
<p>Cited reasons to fix this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting better data</li>
<li>Getting a Data strategy and governance framework</li>
<li>Hiring smarter people</li>
<li>Something..something DataOps, AI</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all lovely ideas, but moving the lever on these are often impossible or impractical.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Change your mindset (and how you run projects)</li>
</ol>
<p>Data analytics is an exploratory and scientific endeavour that isn’t supposed to succeed every time. Just like not all lab experiments yield positive results. Instead of lamenting failures, develop a mindset of innovation and agile working where new ideas are prototyped and investment in R&amp;D promoted but capped and balanced.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Pick better projects</li>
</ol>
<p>A question I get all the time, is how to get started with data science projects in an established business. Often there is a disconnect between those doing the work and those deciding what to do. The most undervalued skill in delivering value with data science teams is picking projects that are likely to succeed. There is no shortcut - it takes years of hard earned experience and it requires a balance of hands-on technical skills, with commercial awareness.</p>

  <title>Man vs Machine Learning</title>
  <dc:creator>Dean Marchiori</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Over the past few years I have been doing more and more work in Microsoft Azure and the Azure Machine Learning Studio. One feature of the Azure ML studio is an <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/machine-learning/automatedml/#overview">automated machine learning feature</a>. This is essentially a no-code UI that ‘empowers professional and <em>nonprofessional</em> data scientists to build machine learning models rapidly’ (emphasis mine).</p>
<p>While many (including me) have leveled a fair amount of criticism towards such solutions, I thought it would be worth seeing what the fuss was about.</p>
<p>Could I go head-to-head on the same predictive modelling challenge and compete with the might of Microsoft’s AutoML solution? Even worse, would I enjoy it? Even more worse, could I win??</p>

<section id="method-1-azure-automl" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="method-1-azure-automl">Method 1: Azure AutoML</h2>
<p>The process to set up a new AutoML job was very easy and assumes you are working under somewhat sanitized conditions (which I was in this case).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-06-02-man-vs-ml-20230619T002502Z-001/2023-06-02-man-vs-ml/automl.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Once you kick it off, it chugged away for an hour and 33 minutes. To my horror, I realized it takes the ‘kitchen sink’ approach and fits a suite of 41 (!) different machine learning models at the training data. Hyperparameter tuning is done by constructing a validation set using K-Fold cross validation.</p>
<p><video src="models.webm" class="img-fluid" controls=""><a href="models.webm">Video</a></video></p>
<p>The best performing model is then selected and then predictions are run on the test set. It’s a little concerning that Test set evaluation is only in ‘Preview’ mode. It was also very confusing to dig out the results on the test set. Most of the metrics prominently displayed are overly confident in-sample accuracy results.</p>
<p>The winning model in my case was a ‘Voting Ensemble’ of three models</p>
<ul>
<li>MaxAbsScaler, ExtremeRandomTrees</li>
<li>StandardScalerWrapper, XGBoostRegressor<br>
</li>
<li>StandardScalerWrapper, LightGBM</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall the process was very easy and user friendly. It look a long time to train, but I didn’t have to think about anything - at all (which is usually time consuming) so overall it was a quick solution. I trained the model on a Standard_DS11_v2 (2 cores, 14 GB RAM, 28 GB disk) compute instance which costs $0.2 per hour. So it cost money, but not much.</p>
<p>Performance evaluation to follow below…</p>

<section id="method-2-manual-time-series-model-in-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="method-2-manual-time-series-model-in-r">Method 2: Manual Time Series Model in R</h2>
<p>The process for doing this myself involved much more thought and brain-effort. Here are some notes.</p>
<p>The data set is quite complicated as its sub-daily and has (probably) three seasonal periods (daily, weekly, yearly). There was also maybe some trend and outliers to deal with. The data set also contained covariates such as Temperature and Holiday indicators.</p>
<p>Due to the seasonal complexity many traditional statistical methods were not appropriate like straight ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) and ETS (exponential smoothing). While STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) can handle multiple seasonal periods I wanted a method to handle the covariates (like Temperature and Holidays). My next step was to think of Time Series Linear Regression models. However, accounting for yearly seasonality with 30min data meant fitting 17,520 (2 * 24 * 365) parameters just for this seasonal period. Which seemed excessive.</p>
<p>For longer, multiple-seasonal periods, using Fourier terms can be a good idea. Here a smaller number of terms in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series">fourier series</a> can be estimated to approximate a more complex function. This type of <em>Dynamic Harmonic Regression</em><sup>2</sup> can also handle exogenous covariates and we can even fit the model with ARIMA errors to account for the short term dynamics of time series data.</p>
<p>In fact, this very approach was outlined in the excellent <em>Forecasting: Principles and Practice</em><sup>3</sup> using this very same example data set. I decided to borrow (steal) the ideas of creating a piece-wise linear trend for temperature. I also went a bit crazy with encoding specific holiday dummy variables and some other tweaks.</p>
<p>Overall I found this method slow to fit, and not overly performant. I decided next to try fitting a Prophet<sup>4</sup> model. Prophet is an open-source automated algorithm for time series forecasting developed by Facebook. It uses a Bayesian framework to fit complex, non-linear, piece-wise regression models. For complex time series data, it provides a decent, fast framework including exogenous variables, holiday and seasonal effects. I didn’t do any principled hyperparameter tuning, but I did fiddle around with the model a bit.</p>

<p>So overall it was pretty close, but in terms of pure predictive performance, the AutoML platform did pip me at the post. Admittedly, the solution I arrived at was probably more of an ML solution than a ‘classical’ time series method given it is still an automated algorithm. If I had more time and patience I probably could have pursued a more complex regression model. In fact in <em>Forecasting: Principles and Practice</em>, the authors also cite the performance of a straight Dynamic Harmonic Regression is limited, however they go on to propose other innovative approaches<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>, including splitting the problem into separate models for each 30min period and using regression splines to better capture exogenous effects. So it can be done, but not without a huge amount of effort.</p>

<h1>Bonus Round: Medicare Cost Forecast</h1>
<p>This all led me to think: If the data are quite complex for a time series problem, then of course a more Machine Learn-y solution would outperform. I wonder what would happen if we repeated the same exercise but with many fewer data points and some quirky time series characteristics.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is, the machine learning models will not have sufficient data to fit well. On the other hand, my experience and gestalt will enable me to select and encode a statistical model that is appropriate and gain an edge on a black-box type of solution.</p>

<section id="who-is-the-winner" class="level1">
<h1>Who is the winner?</h1>
<p>Well, I call it a draw.</p>
<p>Here are some of my closing thoughts from this experiment.</p>
<p>An ML solution might be a good choice if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have lots of data<br>
</li>
<li>You care a lot about prediction<br>
</li>
<li>You don’t have to be too transparent<br>
</li>
<li>Interpretation is not very important<br>
</li>
<li>You have a very complex time series data set</li>
</ul>
<p>I would caveat this with not just blindly modelling your problems away. You still need to understand the process to ensure your predictions are well calibrated and you don’t fall prey to over fitting.</p>
<p>A more classical statistical modelling approach might be a good choice if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want a more flexible framework<br>
</li>
<li>You need to / want to encode domain knowledge<br>
</li>
<li>You want a more interpretable model</li>
<li>You have fewer data</li>
</ul>
<p>The good news is, if you are sufficiently smart and motivated (which I am sure you are) you can certainly compete in terms of model performance with an ML solution, even on complex problems. The bad news is, it’s harder and you need to think a bit. You can’t just delegate all your thinking to the machines. Not yet anyway.</p>

  <title>Level up your Forecasting</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>This is a time series data set of half-hourly electricity demand for Victoria, Australia <sup>1</sup>. You may not care about electricity forecasting, but there is probably some similar time series in your organisation you do care about.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<div>
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-05-29-forecasting/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="672"></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>What is the forecast demand for the next week?</strong></p>
<p>Who knows? I certainly don’t know, despite doing forecasting for a job.</p>
<p>In fact, anyone who tells you they do know (with certainty) is wrong.</p>
<section id="but-i-need-to-make-a-forecast-so-what-do-i-do" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="but-i-need-to-make-a-forecast-so-what-do-i-do">But I need to make a forecast, so what do I do?</h2>
<p>Often you have to come up with something. Finance needs an estimate of sales or budgets, or your manager needs something to take to the board. So you have to churn out some numbers. But what numbers?</p>
<p>Here are two extremes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You could ignore all historical data and just use the most recent data point as the most reliable forecast.<br>
</li>
<li>You could ignore any specific value and just take the average of everything.</li>
</ol>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<div>
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-05-29-forecasting/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="672"></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Both are in the ballpark but they aren’t very squiggly like the real data. They clearly aren’t capturing the <em>seasonality</em>.</p>
<p>You could be lazy (clever) and just use the same time period from <em>last</em> week as your current forecast. It actually looks really good. But it’s just one, fixed realization of what could happen. Will it play out exactly like your forecast? <em>Exactly</em> like last week? Almost certainly not.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<div>
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-05-29-forecasting/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="672"></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s simulate another way history could play out. (By statistically resampling the residuals in the training data)</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>And another</p>

<figure class="figure">

<p>And 20 more:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So instead of blindly relying on one (kind of okay looking, but totally unrealistic) forecast, we now have a ‘fuzzy’ region of plausible values.</p>
</section>
<section id="ok-but-why-bother" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ok-but-why-bother">Ok but why bother?</h2>
<p>If you don’t know with certainty what your forecast is going to be, then don’t just give one concrete number. It’s misleading.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Its more important to know how uncertain your forecast is rather than what your forecast is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can still pull out a mean or point estimate but by delivering the whole story you are conveying not just what you think is likely to happen, but how certain you are about it.</p>
<p>Often this can lead to more meaningful discussions. Perhaps it’s not the mean of your forecast distribution that you care about, its the extreme values. For example, If I was stress testing business cash flows and forecasting the cost of a maintenance activity, I’d be more interested in forecasting the 95% upper limit of forecast costs rather than the ‘expected’ cost.</p>
<p>In practice, you often don’t have to do any mathematical simulations. Proper time series forecasts have methods to calculate prediction intervals out of the box (see below).</p>

<p>A huge criticism of providing probabilistic forecasts is that is seems like you are ‘hedging your bets’ and being evasive. The reality is, in our electricity example, it was just very hot and demand surged (much higher than even our 95% prediction interval). So if it’s realistic and plausible to see forecast values in these ranges (or even more extreme) - Why wouldn’t you want to include that information in your forecast??</p>

<p>In practice a statistician will likely use a more sophisticated model than presented here. These models may take into account temperature and other factors but there will still be unexplained variance that will need to be quantified if you want a quality forecast produced.</p>

  <title>Random Number Generator Testing</title>
  <dc:creator>Dean Marchiori</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-05-18-RNG-Testing/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We had really interesting discussion with a company recently who needed a random number generator certified.</p>
<p>Randomness, like time or space, is one of these deep concepts that are super hard to reason about. Despite this, it’s fairly common to see random number generators in practice. A casino will use one in their gaming software to randomise outcomes; A lottery or competition website will use one to pick winners; Scientists use them to run simulations and cryptographic applications are powered by some form of randomness.</p>
<p>Flash back to the 1980’s where down-on-his-luck unemployed ice cream man Michael Larsen cracked the (non-random) pattern in TV game show <em>Press Your Luck</em> and took them for over $100k. Sadly it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170712041017/http://www.rotten.com/library/conspiracy/press-your-luck/">didnt end well for Larsen</a> with Ponzi schemes, radio station challenges awry and a break and enter. But it goes to show what can happen if you don’t take randomness seriously.</p>

<section id="aside-ok-but-what-is-random-and-who-is-ramsey" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aside-ok-but-what-is-random-and-who-is-ramsey">(Aside) Ok but what is random? And who is Ramsey?</h2>
<p>Randomness is an actual or apparent lack of pattern, but it’s kind of hard to test and even its very nature is somewhat unclear. In 1903, a British mathematician called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Ramsey_(mathematician)">Frank Ramsey</a> was born. Ramsey was a militant atheist, but interestingly his brother went on to become Archbishop of Canterbury. He went on to study mathematics and economics, becoming a student of famous economist John Maynard Keynes. Somehow he ended up also translating a German book of logical philosophy into English and joined a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Apostles">secret intellectual society</a> just after the war. A minor discovery of his ended up blossoming into what is known as Ramsey theory, which is a theory in mathematical combinatorics showing that in any sufficiently large system, however disordered, there is always <em>some</em> order. This has had interesting (and conspiratorial) implications for whether there is even such a thing as ‘random’. Oh and by the way, all this happened before he died at age 26 after complications from liver disease likely caused by swimming in a river.</p>
</section>
<section id="types-of-random-number-generators-rngs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-random-number-generators-rngs">Types of Random Number Generators (RNGs)</h2>
<p>Generally RNG’s can generate <strong>True</strong> random numbers or <strong>Pseudo</strong> random numbers. True RNGs generate random bits from natural stochastic sources like background radiation, quantum effects, atmospheric noise etc. Next time you are tempted to toss a coin, perhaps head over to <a href="random.org">random.org</a> instead for some ‘true’ randomness.</p>
<p>There is a fun <a href="https://www.random.org/history/">history lesson</a> for how random.org got started with true RNG’s generated using random static from a cheap $10 radio, laden with a post-it note advising passers by not to fiddle with the knobs.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-05-18-RNG-Testing/random.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Early true RNG using atmospheric noise from a cheap radio</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Pseudo-random numbers are generated using a ‘seed’ that deterministically produces numbers that look random, but can be entirely reproduced from the initial seed condition. This is often useful (and used by me all the time) when you need a random sample, but you need it to replicated exactly for scientific reproducibility purposes.</p>
</section>
<section id="statistical-tests" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-tests">Statistical Tests</h2>
<p>Given randomness itself is hard to test, there are a number of statistical test suites that perform a battery of diagnostics on a large sample of random numbers in order to test various aspects of randomness. One prominent test suite for cryptographic random bits is developed by <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a> which uses <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-22/rev-1a/final">15 different statistical tests.</a></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Frequency (Monobit) Test</li>
<li>Frequency Test within a Block</li>
<li>The Runs Test</li>
<li>Tests for the Longest-Run-of-Ones in a Block</li>
<li>The Binary Matrix Rank Test</li>
<li>The Discrete Fourier Transform (Spectral) Test</li>
<li>The Non-overlapping Template Matching Test</li>
<li>The Overlapping Template Matching Test</li>
<li>Maurer’s “Universal Statistical” Test</li>
<li>The Linear Complexity Test</li>
<li>The Serial Test</li>
<li>The Approximate Entropy Test</li>
<li>The Cumulative Sums (Cusums) Test</li>
<li>The Random Excursions Test</li>
<li>The Random Excursions Variant Test</li>
</ol>
<p>So, like much of the mathematics behind every day scenarios there is a fascinating history and deep technical and philosophical implications. Given what is on the line for organisations relying on randomness, its useful to engage a specialist to help run and interpret these test suites.</p>
<p>And remember, if you get it wrong, someone unemployed ice-cream man is just waiting to swoop in and take advantage.</p>

<p>In a previous post I linked to a project that makes it easy to deploy and extend an existing <a href="https://rocker-project.org/">Rocker Project</a> Docker image to quickly set up a fully featured RStudio Server environment locally on your machine.</p>
<p>Here I’ll cover some options to deploy this environment to the cloud so you can access it anywhere.</p>
<section id="option-1-deploy-to-a-virtual-machine" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-1-deploy-to-a-virtual-machine">Option 1: Deploy to a Virtual Machine</h2>
<p>A common pattern is to create a Virtual Machine (VM) with a cloud service provider (such as AWS, Azure, GCP) and run your code there. I’ll cover an example using Microsoft Azure.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Deploy a VM with an Ubuntu operating system. Go ahead and choose the compute power you need.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-03-17-deploy-your-own-rstudio-server-in-the-cloud/rstudio-rg.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Configure a custom network rule to allow traffic on port 8787 for RStudio</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-03-17-deploy-your-own-rstudio-server-in-the-cloud/nsg.png" class="img-fluid"><br>
3. Log into your new VM terminal using SSH</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-03-17-deploy-your-own-rstudio-server-in-the-cloud/term.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Install Docker Engine by following <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">these steps</a></p></li>
<li><p>Clone and Deploy the docker container from Step 2 <a href="https://github.com/deanmarchiori/ds-env-setup">in my guide.</a></p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="option-2-deploy-using-azure-app-service" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-2-deploy-using-azure-app-service">Option 2: Deploy using Azure App Service</h2>
<p>The above is fine, but arguably if you are setting up a VM from scratch for development purposes I’m not sure what benefit there is from using a docker container. You may as well just directly install what you want and consider the VM a ‘container’.</p>
<p>However, if you plan to make this available to other users in your organisation, or to adapt this guide for Shiny App development you may be interested in other features such as TLS/SSL security, scale up, advanced networking, continuous integration, continuous deployment, staging/production deployment slots etc. This represents a shift from development sandpit to ‘web app’. For this case, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/app-service/">Azure App Service</a> may be a lower hassle option. This is Microsoft’s enterprise grade, web app deployment managed service.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Virtual Machine</strong> model you are setting up compute infrastructure, deploying and running containers directly - then fiddling with the infrastructure layer for everything else. In <strong>App Service</strong> you deploy your custom docker container (here containing RStudio Server) to Azure Container Registry (kind of like DockerHub). Azure App Services then builds and serves your app from there - without you having to stand up and manage an Infra layer directly.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-03-17-deploy-your-own-rstudio-server-in-the-cloud/appservices.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create Azure Container Registry (ACR) (or some other Docker repository) using this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-custom-container?tabs=azure-portal&amp;pivots=container-linux#ii-create-a-container-registry">help guide</a></p></li>
<li><p>Run and test your container locally</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy your local container to ACR using this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-custom-container?tabs=azure-portal&amp;pivots=container-linux#iii-push-the-sample-image-to-azure-container-registry">help guide</a></p></li>
<li><p>Create a new web app in Azure App Services using this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-custom-container?tabs=azure-portal&amp;pivots=container-linux#v-create-the-web-app">help guide</a></p></li>
<li><p>Configuration:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t have to fiddle with ports, presumably it reads the exposed ports in the docker file and does this magically.<br>
</li>
<li>For custom environment variables like the RStudio Server password, I had to manually add this in the config section.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-03-17-deploy-your-own-rstudio-server-in-the-cloud/env.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>and it worked just fine:</p>

  <title>Building your own R Data Science Lab in the browser</title>

<p>Most R users probably just run <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">RStudio Desktop</a> from Posit on their local computers. This involves manually installing R, RStudio and all other packages.</p>
<p>However it is often the case that users are operating in a restricted computing environment, such as in a corporate or government setting. Alternatively you may wish to create a custom development environment to test or replicate some other specific setup. This is a good case to move away from locally managed software to containerization, such as Docker.</p>
<p>I have set up a <a href="https://github.com/deanmarchiori/ds-env-setup">Github repository</a> that sets up a local data science development environment in the browser.</p>
<p>It builds a docker container including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
<li>R version 4.2</li>
<li>RStudio Server 2022.02.3+492</li>
<li>All tidyverse packages and devtools</li>
<li>tex &amp; publishing-related package</li>
</ul>
<p>The image builds on the rocker/verse image from <a href="https://rocker-project.org/">Rocker Project.</a></p>
<p>Some other enhanced configuration options are included in the Dockerfile, such as preloading you RStudio preferences to get the same look and feel you have locally, the option to install other CRAN packages &amp; mounting local volumes to persist your work locally.</p>
<p>Go here for Step by step instructions:</p>

  <title>Beware of Boundaries in Binominal Proportion Confidence Intervals</title>
  <dc:creator>Dean Marchiori</dc:creator>
  <link>https://www.deanmarchiori.com/posts/2023-03-13-choosing-the-right-binomial-confidence-interval/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Binomial proportion confidence intervals are often employed when attempting to perform tests for significance, or sample size calculations around sample measurements resulting from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process">Bernoulli process.</a></p>
<p>The typical choice when calculating binomial proportion confidence intervals is the asymptotic, or normally approximated ‘Wald’ interval where success probability is measured by:</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Chat%7Bp%7D%20%5Cpm%20z_%7B%5Calpha/2%7D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Chat%7Bp%7D(1-%5Chat%7Bp%7D)%7D%7Bn%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>In many settings, such as marketing analytics or manufacturing processes the sample proportion is close to 0 or 1. Evaluating asymptotic confidence intervals near these boundary conditions will lead to underestimation of the error, and in some cases producing an interval outside <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5B0,%201%5D">.</p>
<p>Fortunately other methods exist, such as Wilson’s score interval, exact methods and Bayesian approaches. The recommendation here is to examine the probability coverage and explore alternative methods for sample size and CI calculation, especially when the parameter is near the boundary conditions, or in cases of very small n.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have a manufacturing process in the day job that is subject to sample auditing.</p>
<p>There are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> widgets produced and we need to audit <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> of them. Some sort of rejection threshold is needed on that sample to decide if the whole batch of widgets has met a specified quality level.</p>
<p>Typically, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a> would be appropriate for measuring the probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> successes (in this case defects found) in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> independent trials with probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0APr(X=k)%20=%20%7Bn%20%5Cchoose%20k%7D%20p%5Ek(1-p)%5E%7Bn-k%7D%0A"></p>
<p>The word <em>independent</em> is doing a lot of work here as it implies that we are sampling <em>with</em> replacement in order to maintain a fixed probability parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">.</p>
<p>In cases where you are taking draws from a population <em>without</em> replacement (such as when you do destructive inspections on a widget) the underlying population changes with each draw and so does the probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">.</p>
<p>In this case, modelling the process using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution">hypergeometric distribution</a> may be a more appropriate choice.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0APr(X=k)%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B%7BK%20%5Cchoose%20k%7D%7BN-K%20%5Cchoose%20n-k%7D%7D%7B%7BN%20%5Cchoose%20n%7D%7D%0A"></p>
<p>It similarly describes the probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?k"> successes in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> draws without replacement. However, instead of specifying a parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">, we provide the population size <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N">, which contains <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K"> success states in the population.</p>
<section id="example" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let’s say we have 2000 widgets manufactured and we want to sample 50 (ignore why 50, that is a whole separate question). We have an assumed quality level of 10% defective units (which we define as ‘success’ for complicated reasons).</p>
<p>Q: Based on a sample of 50 widgets how many defective units would be considered unlikely (95% CI) to occur randomly given our assumed quality level, and therefore result in us rejecting the entire batch?</p>
<p>We can compare the binomial probability mass function with the hypergeometric and observe they are essentially the same.</p>

<p>As a consequence of removing samples in each draw we influence the probability of a subsequent success. If our <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?K"> is very large relative to our sample <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> this wont make much of an impact, but it can be impactful for smaller populations, or relatively larger samples.</p>
<p>From our example above, failing to use a hypergeometric distribution to model this process for smaller populations will result in wider, more conservative acceptance regions which can increase consumer risk in a manufacturing process.</p>
<p>Typical guidance on when to use each distribution is given in manufacturing standards such as <em>AS 1199.1-2003: Sampling Procedures for Inspection by Attributes</em> and typically involves how you structure your sampling scheme.</p>

  <title>Prediction Intervals for Linear Mixed Effects Models</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>A recent project with repeated measures data involved fitting a random intercept term, and eventually making predictions for new groups not in the training sample. Importantly there was a need for individual predictions rather than population mean level predictions. Now, you obviously cannot include the random effect for a level that is not in your data, so the idea was to make a population level prediction with an adequate prediction interval that reflected the variation from both the fixed and random effects. This is complicated.</p>
<p>In the help page for <code>lme4::predict.merMod()</code> is the following note:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ul>
<li>There is no option for computing standard errors of predictions because it is difficult to define an efficient method that incorporates uncertainty in the variance parameters; we recommend bootMer for this task.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some useful resources out there but it took a while to track down, so this post may serve as a good reference in the future.</p>
<p>Let’s go through an example using the famous <code>sleepstudy</code> data showing the average reaction time per day (in milliseconds) for subjects in a sleep deprivation study.</p>

<p>However, this gets complicated if we want to make predictions for <em>new</em> subjects.</p>
<p>We can no longer condition on the random effects, as the new subject level will not have a fitted random intercept value. Instead we need to effectively make a population level prediction (i.e.&nbsp;set the random effect to zero.). This makes sense as we don’t know what the random effect ought to be for a given, unobserved subject.</p>
<p>But we don’t want the prediction interval to just cover the uncertainty in the population level estimate. If we are interested in individual predictions, how can we incorporate the uncertainly of the random effects in the prediction intervals?</p>
<p>Lets generate a new, unobserved subject.</p>

<p>However using <code>predict</code> just results in a completely deterministic prediction as shown above.</p>
<p>An alternative approach is to use <code>lme4::simulate()</code> which will simulate responses for subjects non-deterministically using the fitted model object.</p>

<p>So while we don’t have a conditional mode of the random effect (because its a new subject) we can derive a bootstrapped estimate of the prediction interval by resampling the random effects and model errors on simulated data values.</p>

<section id="aside" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="aside">Aside</h2>
<p>For comparison, here is what the same prediction interval would look like if we just used an unconditional population prediction. While the overall gist is the same, despite also resampling both the random effects and the i.i.d. errors, the interval is narrower as it is resampling just the deterministic population predictions of the model.</p>

  <title>Optimal Stopping Problems</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The August 2022 edition of Significance Magazine posts a challenge:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Choosing a husband</strong>: In the court of King Arthur, a damsel, Elfreda needs to choose a husband. Each day for the next 100 days Knights will come to Calemlot to be interviewed by Arthur to be Elfreda’s husband. However once the Knights left the castle they did not return. She needed to decide as soon as she saw a knight whether to marry or pass. In the challenge, Elfreda is given the advice from Merlin to not pick any of the first 37, just look and decide who is best, then pick the next knight who is better than that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The questions are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Why did Merlin instruct Elfreda to ignore the first 37 suitors?</p></li>
<li><p>What did Merlin think was the probability that Elfreda would choose the very best knight with this strategy?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a well known problem in Optimal Stopping theory. When you look at the first few knights you have no information about how they rank relative to all 100. But by the time you have assessed most of the 100 knights you have information but you have no agency. The knights have all moved on and you either miss out or have to settle for whoever is left.</p>
<p>This problem comes up every time I look for a parking spot on a busy day. Do I take the first spot I find a long way from the beach? I could try to get a closer spot but may not find one and could miss out entirely. Most likely the earlier spots are now taken.</p>
<p><strong>When is the optimal time to stop looking and take the leap?</strong></p>
<p>The strategy here is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Just <em>Look</em> at a given number of knights without commiting to any<br>
</li>
<li>Note the best ranking knight of out of the ones we looked at<br>
</li>
<li>Commit to the very next knight that is <em>better</em> than the best ranked so far.</li>
</ol>
<p>We assume we look at least one knight before stopping our search and assume that if we fail to find a superior knight after our <em>looking</em> period - we miss out! We obviously wont settle for less. (I guess I could force this to accept the last one in line - not a big deal).</p>
<section id="simulation-in-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simulation-in-r">Simulation in R</h2>
<p>We can simulate this problem by sampling 100 random knights and assigning them a random ranking of 1-100 (assume 100 is best).</p>

<p><strong>So we should let the first 37 knights pass, just like Merlin said. If we do this, we will give ourselves roughly 37% probability of picking the most optimal knight, which is the best we can do.</strong></p>

<p>So why 37 days and 37% probability?</p>
<p>If we assume we reject the first <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r-1"> knights and then choose the next best knight we get to probability</p>

<p>We want to know which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r"> maximises the probability for large <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">. As <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> approaches infinity we can let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> be the limit of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r/n"> and use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t"> for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j/n"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dt"> for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1/n"> we get the integral</p>

<p>If we take the derivative with respect to x and set the equation to zero we can find the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> which maximises this probability:</p>

  <title>Three Stick Statistics</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>When I was a teenager I was very popular among my peers, which is why I spent every second Saturday playing in a retiree’s social golf club. For each event we would travel via air-conditioned coach to a local public golf course and play some sort of themed game. The most exciting event was the <em>three stick event</em>. This game requires players to pick just <strong>three</strong> golf clubs out of their bag (plus a putter) to play their entire round (you can take up to 14 clubs on a normal round).</p>
<p>So which three clubs do you pick?</p>
<p>This was easy for me as I could only reliably hit two clubs: the five iron and the seven iron. I usually included a driver so as not be mocked by the septuagenarians at the par-5 tees.</p>
<p>I also have an embarrassingly crap collection of golf clubs as many have been sent to an early retirement in water features.</p>
<p>However, many friends who now play golf have a bewildering selection of exotic clubs from hybrid driving irons to 60-degree lob-wedges.</p>
<p>It seems like in there is always some new technology or method to master in data science broadly. This is interesting, but also exhausting and fills me with existential dread that I am becoming irrelevant.</p>
<p>It got me thinking, if you had to play statistics (or data science) for the rest of your career with just three algorithms/models, what would they be?</p>
<section id="my-three-sticks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-three-sticks">My three sticks:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Random Forest</strong>: Uncontroversial ensemble method that can quickly get a performance ceiling with minimal fuss. It lacks some interpretability, but I’ll keep it in my bag for when I want to squeeze as much AUC as I can in a prediction setting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generalised Additive Model (GAM)</strong>: You could argue this is quite broad, but that’s okay. I’ve had good luck with GAMs as they provide a solid statistical approach that I am comfortable with, along with the flexibility of using smooths for non-linear terms that seems to be a key feature in the problems I have to solve. If I had to only pick one club this would probably be it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>k-medoids clustering:</strong> Clustering methods are a great third club to have in your bag. They solve a different problem to the modelling tasks above and provide a good hedge for those unsupervised tasks that come along fairly regularly. While everyone knows k-means, I enjoy the increased interpretation of k-medoids as the cluster centers are always one of the input data points. It also allows for more generalised distance methods (such as Gower’s distance) which I have found useful for mixed data types.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can include <code>lm()</code> as the default putter you get for free.</p>
<p>Which three clubs would you pick in your bag?</p>
