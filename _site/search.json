    "title": "An Empirical Modelling and Simulation Framework for Fire Events Initiated by Vegetation and Electricity Network Interactions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Electrical infrastructure is one of the major causes of bushfire in Australia alongside arson and lightning strikes. The two main causes of electrical-infrastructure-initiated fires are asset failure and powerline vegetation interactions. In this paper, we focus on powerline–vegetation interactions that are caused by vegetation falling onto or blowing onto electrical infrastructure. Currently, there is very limited understanding of both the spatio-temporal variability of these events and their causative factors. Bridging this knowledge gap provides an opportunity for electricity utility companies to optimally allocate vegetation management resources and to understand the risk profile presented by vegetation fall-in initiated fires, thereby improving both operational planning and strategic resource allocation. To bridge this knowledge gap, we developed a statistical rare-event modelling and simulation framework based on Endeavour Energy’s fire start and incident records from the last 10 years. The modelling framework consists of nested, rare-event-corrected, conditional probability models for vegetation events and consequent ignition events that provide an overall model for vegetation-initiated ignitions. Model performance was tested on an out-of-time test set to determine the predictive utility of the models. Predictive performance was reasonable with test set AUC values of 0.79 and 0.66 for the vegetation event and ignition event models, respectively. The modelling indicates that wind speed and vegetation features are strongly associated with vegetation events, and that Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) and soil type are strongly associated with ignition events. The framework can be used by energy utilities to optimize resource allocation and prepare future networks for climate change.\nLink: https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6255/6/2/61"

For each event we would travel via air-conditioned coach to a local public golf course and play some sort of themed game. The most exciting event was the three stick event. This game requires players to pick just three golf clubs out of their bag (plus a putter) to play their entire round (you can take up to 14 clubs on a normal round).\nSo which three clubs do you pick?\nThis was easy for me as I could only reliably hit two clubs: the five iron and the seven iron. I usually included a driver so as not be mocked by the septuagenarians at the par-5 tees.\nI also have an embarrassingly crap collection of golf clubs as many have been sent to an early retirement in water features.\nHowever, many friends who now play golf have a bewildering selection of exotic clubs from hybrid driving irons to 60-degree lob-wedges.\nIt seems like in there is always some new technology or method to master in data science broadly. This is interesting, but also exhausting and fills me with existential dread that I am becoming irrelevant.\nIt got me thinking, if you had to play statistics (or data science) for the rest of your career with just three algorithms/models, what would they be?"

It lacks some interpretability, but I’ll keep it in my bag for when I want to squeeze as much AUC as I can in a prediction setting.\nGeneralised Additive Model (GAM): You could argue this is quite broad, but that’s okay. I’ve had good luck with GAMs as they provide a solid statistical approach that I am comfortable with, along with the flexibility of using smooths for non-linear terms that seems to be a key feature in the problems I have to solve. If I had to only pick one club this would probably be it.\nk-medoids clustering: Clustering methods are a great third club to have in your bag. They solve a different problem to the modelling tasks above and provide a good hedge for those unsupervised tasks that come along fairly regularly. While everyone knows k-means, I enjoy the increased interpretation of k-medoids as the cluster centers are always one of the input data points. It also allows for more generalised distance methods (such as Gower’s distance) which I have found useful for mixed data types.\n\nWe can include lm() as the default putter you get for free.\nWhich three clubs would you pick in your bag?"

When you look at the first few knights you have no information about how they rank relative to all 100. But by the time you have assessed most of the 100 knights you have information but you have no agency. The knights have all moved on and you either miss out or have to settle for whoever is left.\nThis problem comes up every time I look for a parking spot on a busy day. Do I take the first spot I find a long way from the beach? I could try to get a closer spot but may not find one and could miss out entirely. Most likely the earlier spots are now taken.\nWhen is the optimal time to stop looking and take the leap?\nThe strategy here is:\nWe assume we look at least one knight before stopping our search and assume that if we fail to find a superior knight after our looking period - we miss out! We obviously wont settle for less. (I guess I could force this to accept the last one in line - not a big deal)."

You may as well just directly install what you want and consider the VM a ‘container’.\nHowever, if you plan to make this available to other users in your organisation, or to adapt this guide for Shiny App development you may be interested in other features such as TLS/SSL security, scale up, advanced networking, continuous integration, continuous deployment, staging/production deployment slots etc. This represents a shift from development sandpit to ‘web app’. For this case, Azure App Service may be a lower hassle option. This is Microsoft’s enterprise grade, web app deployment managed service.\nIn the Virtual Machine model you are setting up compute infrastructure, deploying and running containers directly - then fiddling with the infrastructure layer for everything else. In App Service you deploy your custom docker container (here containing RStudio Server) to Azure Container Registry (kind of like DockerHub). Azure App Services then builds and serves your app from there - without you having to stand up and manage an Infra layer directly.\n\n\nCreate Azure Container Registry (ACR) (or some other Docker repository) using this help guide\nRun and test your container locally\nDeploy your local container to ACR using this help guide\nCreate a new web app in Azure App Services using this help guide\nConfiguration:\n\n\nI didn’t have to fiddle with ports, presumably it reads the exposed ports in the docker file and does this magically.\n\nFor custom environment variables like the RStudio Server password, I had to manually add this in the config section.\n\n\nand it worked just fine:"

Rather than use the typical term counts, a binary indicator was used if a term appears in an episode. This was preferred as the user’s text input is unlikely to really mimic the detail of an episode description, which threw the similarity measure out a bit.\nOnce a user inputs text, the Shiny app dynamically forms a new term vector and compares it to the all-episode’s matrix using cosine distance. The episodes are then ranked based on smallest cosine distance and displayed to the users.\nFor the source code visit: https://github.com/deanmarchiori/bluey-search"

If our \\(N\\) and \\(K\\) is very large relative to our sample \\(n\\) this wont make much of an impact, but it can be impactful for smaller populations, or relatively larger samples.\nFrom our example above, failing to use a hypergeometric distribution to model this process for smaller populations will result in wider, more conservative acceptance regions which can increase consumer risk in a manufacturing process.\nTypical guidance on when to use each distribution is given in manufacturing standards such as AS 1199.1-2003: Sampling Procedures for Inspection by Attributes and typically involves how you structure your sampling scheme."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Binomial proportion confidence intervals are often employed when attempting to perform tests for significance, or sample size calculations around sample measurements resulting from a Bernoulli process.\nThe typical choice when calculating binomial proportion confidence intervals is the asymptotic, or normally approximated ‘Wald’ interval where success probability is measured by:\n\\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\nIn many settings, such as marketing analytics or manufacturing processes the sample proportion is close to 0 or 1. Evaluating asymptotic confidence intervals near these boundary conditions will lead to underestimation of the error, and in some cases producing an interval outside \\([0, 1]\\).\nFortunately other methods exist, such as Wilson’s score interval, exact methods and Bayesian approaches. The recommendation here is to examine the probability coverage and explore alternative methods for sample size and CI calculation, especially when the parameter is near the boundary conditions, or in cases of very small n. \n\nlibrary(binom)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nn &lt;- 50\np &lt;- c(0.01, 0.5, 0.99)\n\n\nx &lt;- purrr::map_df(p, .f =  ~binom.confint(x = n * .x, n = n, methods = 'all'))\n\n\nggplot(x, aes(colour = factor(x))) +\n  geom_point(aes(mean, method), show.legend = F) +\n  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper, y = method), show.legend = F) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept =  c(0, 1), lty = 2, col = \"grey\") +\n  facet_wrap(~(x*2/100)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"A variety of binomial confidence interval methods for p = 0.01, 0.5 & 0.99\",\n       subtitle = \"Note unusual behaviour near 0.01 and 0.99\")\n\n\n\n\n\ncov &lt;- purrr::map_df(p, ~binom.coverage(.x, n, conf.level = 0.95, method = \"all\"))\n\n\nggplot(cov, aes(colour = factor(p))) +\n  geom_point(aes(coverage, method), show.legend = F) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept =  0.95, lty = 2) +\n  facet_wrap(~(p)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Probability coverage for a variety of binomial confidence interval methods\",\n       subtitle = \"Reference line at 0.95 coverage\")\n\n\n\n\nA good discussion is contained in:\nWallis, Sean A.
