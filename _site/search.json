While R remains a popular choice for statistical modelling and data analysis, its rapid development has enabled users to progress their work right through to being deployed into Production. However the type of work done when conducting experiments and developing models is very different to packaging up this work so it can reliably drive decisions in an organisation. This book will provide readers with an overview of contemporary frameworks for how data analysis is done in practice. It will cover how R projects are usually structured and how this can evolve based on project complexity. It will examine what is meant by experimental vs production analysis code and which principles need to be adopted. Finally it will show current tools and frameworks for taking experimental R code and strengthening it to align with best practice for reliable production grade software. Readers can step through a case study and download code to follow along."

    "title": "Data Science Workflows: Inner Loop vs Outer Loop",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In a previous post I discussed the charming nostalgia of CRISP-DM as a data analysis workflow choice.\nA modern limitation of this model is how it handles the Deployment step. In the olden days this was usually some form of static report to a client. It’s a loaded topic now with deployment usually having something to do with giving money to AWS/MSFT or a battle to the death with your IT department.\nIn a practical sense this usually means rigging up an endpoint for your analysis like an API, shiny app, dashboard or similar. Managing this process is rapidly becoming it’s own sub-speciality, fashionably called MLOps.\nA useful way to think about this is in terms of Inner Loop vs Outer Loop thinking. I first observed this (for better or worse) in Microsoft’s Azure Machine Learning Classical ML Architecture.\n\n\n\nSource: Microsoft MLOps Accelerator. MIT Licence\n\n\nThe Inner Loop (Item 3 in the above diagram) is everything in CRISP-DM except ‘Deployment’. It covers the whole data identification, EDA and modelling processes. For lack of a better term I usually call this ‘experimental’ code. It’s usually circular, iterative and experimental in nature.\nAt some point you will be happy with an output and want to push it out into the world. This is the Outer Loop (Item 5 in the diagram). It’s its own process and involves more engineer-y tasks like provisioning infrastructure, testing & deployment (usually using some CI/CD pipeline) versioning your model and monitoring for drift, quality etc.\nI see two big issues with this in practice:\n\nAnalysts do the inner loop, declare victory and have no awareness or interest managing the outer loop. This means the analyst needs to re-run the model on their laptop every month and email the results to Kevin, or some such process. Heaven forbid they live in an area of dense, fast moving buses.\nThe analysts want to more formally deploy their models but don’t have the skills, support or permission. In the end, everything gets shoehorned into a PowerBI dashboard or some half-way solution.\n\nMy proposed solutions to this in ascending order of complexity are:\n\nStart implementing more robust controls over how you save, version, monitor and document the outputs of your analysis - including models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMLOps in R\n\n\n\nIf you are an R programmer, the tidymodels team at Posit have recently plugged this gaping hole with the {vetiver} package. https://vetiver.posit.co/\n\n\n\nGet some really light-weight deployment solution to get off the ground like shinyapps.io or a development/sandpit Virtual Machine (in a sensible network location) to throw stuff up on manually and build some goodwill with IT.\nMove to a more commercially palatable ‘walled-garden’ solution like Posit Connect. This strikes a nice balance between being licensed, managed software and giving analysts autonomy in what and how they deploy.\nUtilize your existing cloud providers ML Ops solutions to automate the build and deployment from your version control system - just be careful, this is a slippery slope in terms of complexity and you don’t need to go all-in. This typically keeps IT happy in a heavily regulated environment due to the native integration of network/cloud security protocols.\n\n\nWant to read more?

    "section": "Three questions you can ask your data scientist",
    "text": "Three questions you can ask your data scientist\n\n1. How could the model be unfair?\n\nWhat training data was used, and how was this collected?\nCould certain sub-populations be over or under-represented in this data?\nHave customer details been anonymised?\n\nAre sensitive features used in the model training (race, religion, gender, political preferences).\n\nAlgorithmic unfairness and biases are already huge issues which are only getting worse. Further reading on this topic is covered by Cathy O’Neil’s excellent book Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy3.\n\n\n2. What assumptions does the model make, and how have these been tested?\nAll statistical models have assumptions that are made in order for the math to work out. Models are intended to be simplified representations of reality, deliberately so statisticians can exploit properties like the Central Limit Theorem to help make inferences. For example the assumptions behind a simple linear regression include:\n\nThe response variable can be expressed as a linear combination of the predictors.\n\nThe variance of the error terms is homoscedastic (has constant variance).\n\nThe errors in the response are independent.\n\nIn many cases these can be checked using standard diagnostics tests and plots. However in most cases it requires more in depth domain knowledge and context.\n\n\n3. How accurate is the model?\nEver been told a model is 99% accurate? I’d be very worried if you had. Be skeptical of very high performance.\nxkcd.com highlight this well with their ‘Is it Christmas?’ predictive model.\n\n\nOn what data has the model been tested? Is it a completely independent test set? Was there any leakage from the training data? Was the feature engineering done before or after the training/test split (hint: it usually needs to be after).\nIf your model is a binary classification model, you should know what the ‘null model’ is and whether it outperforms this.\nAccuracy is just one measure and is the proportion of correct classifications (both positive and negative class) but you may have different tolerance for misclassifications of each class. For example, you might be predicting the presence of a disease from a test. If you make a false positive, will the risk of side-effects or cost outweigh the risk the making a false negative and having the patient get sicker or die? It’s tricky.\nIn addition to accuracy ask for the following metrics, along with an explanation of what they mean.\n\nSensitivity / Recall\nSpecificity\nPrecision / Positive Predictive Value\nNegative Predictive Value\nROC AUC\n\nAsk for a confusion matrix. All of the above measures (except ROC) can be calculated from the confusion matrix. Despite its name, it will be instantly clear where the model is working well versus not.\nAsk what cut-off or threshold was used to make the predicted classifications. Many classification models return conditional class probabilities, which need to be converted into labels such as (Yes/No, Cancer/Not Cancer, Churn/Not Churn). A default value is to use a 0.5 probability for the crisp cutoff, but it’s subjective and depends on the desired trade off in sensitivity / specificity as well as other complicated factors like training class imbalance."

To my horror, I realized it takes the ‘kitchen sink’ approach and fits a suite of 41 (!) different machine learning models at the training data. Hyperparameter tuning is done by constructing a validation set using K-Fold cross validation.\nVideo\nThe best performing model is then selected and then predictions are run on the test set. It’s a little concerning that Test set evaluation is only in ‘Preview’ mode. It was also very confusing to dig out the results on the test set.

    "text": "Method 2: Manual Time Series Model in R\nThe process for doing this myself involved much more thought and brain-effort. Here are some notes.\nThe data set is quite complicated as its sub-daily and has (probably) three seasonal periods (daily, weekly, yearly). There was also maybe some trend and outliers to deal with. The data set also contained covariates such as Temperature and Holiday indicators.\nDue to the seasonal complexity many traditional statistical methods were not appropriate like straight ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) and ETS (exponential smoothing). While STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) can handle multiple seasonal periods I wanted a method to handle the covariates (like Temperature and Holidays). My next step was to think of Time Series Linear Regression models. However, accounting for yearly seasonality with 30min data meant fitting 17,520 (2 * 24 * 365) parameters just for this seasonal period. Which seemed excessive.\nFor longer, multiple-seasonal periods, using Fourier terms can be a good idea. Here a smaller number of terms in a fourier series can be estimated to approximate a more complex function. This type of Dynamic Harmonic Regression2 can also handle exogenous covariates and we can even fit the model with ARIMA errors to account for the short term dynamics of time series data.\nIn fact, this very approach was outlined in the excellent Forecasting: Principles and Practice3 using this very same example data set. I decided to borrow (steal) the ideas of creating a piece-wise linear trend for temperature. I also went a bit crazy with encoding specific holiday dummy variables and some other tweaks.\nOverall I found this method slow to fit, and not overly performant. I decided next to try fitting a Prophet4 model. Prophet is an open-source automated algorithm for time series forecasting developed by Facebook. It uses a Bayesian framework to fit complex, non-linear, piece-wise regression models.

Admittedly, the solution I arrived at was probably more of an ML solution than a ‘classical’ time series method given it is still an automated algorithm. If I had more time and patience I probably could have pursued a more complex regression model. In fact in Forecasting: Principles and Practice, the authors also cite the performance of a straight Dynamic Harmonic Regression is limited, however they go on to propose other innovative approaches56, including splitting the problem into separate models for each 30min period and using regression splines to better capture exogenous effects. So it can be done, but not without a huge amount of effort."

Rather than use the typical term counts, a binary indicator was used if a term appears in an episode.

Finance needs an estimate of sales or budgets, or your manager needs something to take to the board. So you have to churn out some numbers. But what numbers?\nHere are two extremes:\n\nYou could ignore all historical data and just use the most recent data point as the most reliable forecast.\n\nYou could ignore any specific value and just take the average of everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth are in the ballpark but they aren’t very squiggly like the real data. They clearly aren’t capturing the seasonality.\nYou could be lazy (clever) and just use the same time period from last week as your current forecast. It actually looks really good. But it’s just one, fixed realization of what could happen. Will it play out exactly like your forecast? Exactly like last week? Almost certainly not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s simulate another way history could play out.

It’s misleading.\n\nIts more important to know how uncertain your forecast is rather than what your forecast is.\n\nYou can still pull out a mean or point estimate but by delivering the whole story you are conveying not just what you think is likely to happen, but how certain you are about it.\nOften this can lead to more meaningful discussions. Perhaps it’s not the mean of your forecast distribution that you care about, its the extreme values. For example, If I was stress testing business cash flows and forecasting the cost of a maintenance activity, I’d be more interested in forecasting the 95% upper limit of forecast costs rather than the ‘expected’ cost.\nIn practice, you often don’t have to do any mathematical simulations. Proper time series forecasts have methods to calculate prediction intervals out of the box (see below)."

    "text": "In previous posts I have discussed frameworks for thinking about data science projects. When it comes to actually writing R code, there are a number of coding workflows you can adopt to get the work done. For example:\n\nMonolithic Notebook (RMarkdown, Quarto)\nDirectory structure with run.R control scripts (e.g. ProjectTemplate)\nOpinionated pipeline tools ({targets}, {drake} etc)\n\nR Package\n\nSo which R workflow should you use?\nUnfortunately this is not a straightforward decision. For quick experimental code you are unlikely to create a new R package. For a complex production deployed model, you really don’t want all your code in one giant R script. It’s hard to know ahead of time what to do and where on this spectrum you will end up.\nIn my view, picking the correct workflow needs to align the project goals and scope. Often this choice can evolve throughout the project.\n\nAn evolution\nA concept or idea might be tested in a single R script, like how you would use the back of a napkin for an idea.\nNext you might break this down into chunks and add some prose, heading and plots so you can share and have other understand it.\nNext you might refactor the messy code into functions to better control the flow and the improve development practices. These functions can be documented and unit tested once you know you want to rely on them.\nTo orchestrate the running and dependency structure to avoid re-running slow and complex code you may use the {targets} package.\nFinally to re-use, share and improve on the functions you might spin these out into their own R package!\n\n\nREPRO-RETRO\nA few years back I gave a short talk at the rstudio::global conference. I talked about how you might want to weight and prioritise the elements of your analysis to make an appropriate choice.\nI framed this through the concept of a reproducibility-retrospective (repro-retro)\nEnjoy.\n\n\n\nWant to read more?

    "text": "We had really interesting discussion with a company recently who needed a random number generator certified.\nRandomness, like time or space, is one of these deep concepts that are super hard to reason about. Despite this, it’s fairly common to see random number generators in practice. A casino will use one in their gaming software to randomise outcomes; A lottery or competition website will use one to pick winners; Scientists use them to run simulations and cryptographic applications are powered by some form of randomness.\nFlash back to the 1980’s where down-on-his-luck unemployed ice cream man Michael Larsen cracked the (non-random) pattern in TV game show Press Your Luck and took them for over $100k. Sadly it didnt end well for Larsen with Ponzi schemes, radio station challenges awry and a break and enter. But it goes to show what can happen if you don’t take randomness seriously."

    "text": "(Aside) Ok but what is random? And who is Ramsey?\nRandomness is an actual or apparent lack of pattern, but it’s kind of hard to test and even its very nature is somewhat unclear. In 1903, a British mathematician called Frank Ramsey was born. Ramsey was a militant atheist, but interestingly his brother went on to become Archbishop of Canterbury. He went on to study mathematics and economics, becoming a student of famous economist John Maynard Keynes. Somehow he ended up also translating a German book of logical philosophy into English and joined a secret intellectual society just after the war. A minor discovery of his ended up blossoming into what is known as Ramsey theory, which is a theory in mathematical combinatorics showing that in any sufficiently large system, however disordered, there is always some order. This has had interesting (and conspiratorial) implications for whether there is even such a thing as ‘random’. Oh and by the way, all this happened before he died at age 26 after complications from liver disease likely caused by swimming in a river."

    "text": "Types of Random Number Generators (RNGs)\nGenerally RNG’s can generate True random numbers or Pseudo random numbers. True RNGs generate random bits from natural stochastic sources like background radiation, quantum effects, atmospheric noise etc. Next time you are tempted to toss a coin, perhaps head over to random.org instead for some ‘true’ randomness.\nThere is a fun history lesson for how random.org got started with true RNG’s generated using random static from a cheap $10 radio, laden with a post-it note advising passers by not to fiddle with the knobs.\n\n\n\nEarly true RNG using atmospheric noise from a cheap radio\n\n\nPseudo-random numbers are generated using a ‘seed’ that deterministically produces numbers that look random, but can be entirely reproduced from the initial seed condition. This is often useful (and used by me all the time) when you need a random sample, but you need it to replicated exactly for scientific reproducibility purposes."

Given what is on the line for organisations relying on randomness, its useful to engage a specialist to help run and interpret these test suites.\nAnd remember, if you get it wrong, someone unemployed ice-cream man is just waiting to swoop in and take advantage."

    "title": "Is ChatGPT is a bullshit machine?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A recent paper published in ‘Ethics and Information Technology’ titled ChatGPT is bullshit 1 is fast becoming one of my favorite papers. Not least because it uses the word bullshit 165 times.\nThe hype surrounding the use of Large Language Models (LLM’s) such as ChatGPT, Bard, Llama, Claude etc has been inescapable lately.\nI have become increasingly concerned with the general willingness to accept that these systems are generating knowledge, truth and reason.\nHere is the key message:\nChatGPT-like models are more kindly described as stochastic parrots3. As the authors of the above paper put it “This means that their primary goal, insofar as they have one, is to produce human-like text. They do so by estimating the likelihood that a particular word will appear next, given the text that has come before.”\nThey are not searching for truth, they are not concerned with the truthyness of their statements. They just want to give a plausible looking response. Without any regard for if it’s right.\nWe often hear about these models ‘hallucinating’ as if its an occassional abberation from its otherwise sensical answers. But this is wrong. It’s a poor metaphor that attempts to anthropomorphize the technology. It’s something that I’ve always hated about recent AI technology. Its need to be ‘human-like’.\nThe reason so many are fooled by the randomness is that humans are, on average more likely to be right than wrong. So a model driven emulation will often be correct. These applications also act as ‘agent-like’ systems when in fact they don’t have agency or cognitive reasoning - but they are designed to be interacted with like they do.\nSo should you use this type of AI? Sure, but consider where it’s appropriate.\nThe benefits in generative and creative applications are impressive and exciting. Applications in pattern recognition, and information retrieval are exciting new ways to think about our relationship with computers.\nTo do nothing and be a luddite would be a mistake. We need more advanced use of algorithmic and model based decisions, but they need to be applied and built in consultation with experts.\nTo surrender your analytical and cognitive reasoning to AI doesn’t make you look hip and smart, it just puts the stochastic parrot on your shoulder.\nThe key here is to understand the fundamentals and take ownership and accountability for the outputs it produces."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Earlier in my career, in the afternath of the GFC I worked as trader for an online share trading platform. Everyday I would get blasted with a firehose of emotion from investors. People day-trading on their accounts, needing help placing exotic trades or dealing during volatile markets.\nIt’s easy to get swept up in the excitement. Sweating on every tick of the market. Listening to the live market news and updates, trying to time it just right.\nI had a holiday booked with my partner, so I took a couple of weeks off and didn’t look at the markets. When I returned, it was like I never left. Everyone was still on the same hamster wheel. The market had moved, but it was kind of the same.\nHaving formal mathematics training lent me some perspective. It reminded me of the famous fractal pattern popularised by Benoit Mandelbrot where certain geometric shapes look similar to themselves as you continually zoom in (a process known as self-similarity1).\nIt got me thinking, was this all just random noise. Was this all just a giant illusion based on psychology, sales targets and the need to fill column inches?\nI recently completed Michael Kemp’s excellent book The Ulysses Contract: How to never worry about the share market again.2\nKemp breaks down common myths around ‘authority’ in financial markets and the tendancy for humans to fall prey to cognitive biases and essentially forgetting history when it comes to the markets. I agreed with nearly every word in the book. Although admitedly, I did blush at how my attitudes differed when I was a freshly minted finance graduate.\nAuthor and interesting person Nassim Nicholas Taleb also writes about this in his 2001 classic Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets.3. Despite his writing style being extrememly abrasive, the underlying points are compelling. Are we all blinded by randomness? Commentating, analysing and taking credit for what is essentially random noise happening to us?"

A random walk is a type of mathematical, time-series model. It describes a process of sequential observations (say, daily share prices). Each day’s share price is simulated by taking yesterday’s price and just adding randomly generated ‘noise’. It doesn’t try to emulate the shape or style of share market. It’s really dumb. It just takes the price one day and either adds or subtracts a small random amount (of normally distributed noise).\nThe funny thing about this model is it often contains4:\n\nlong periods of apparent trends up or down\nsudden and unpredictable changes in direction.\n\nSound like the share market anyone??\nThis can be written as:\n\\[\ny_t = y_{t-1} + e_t\n\\] Really, this is just a special case of a class of time-series models called ARIMA models. In particular it is an Autoregressive model, that is, a model that is formed from linear combination of previous values.\n\\[\ny_t = c + \\phi_1 y_{t-1} + \\phi_2 y_{t-2} + ... + \\phi_p y_{t-p} + e_t\n\\] Where we set just one term \\(\\phi_1 = 1\\), \\(c = 0\\) and specify \\(e_t \\sim N(0, s)\\)"

For each event we would travel via air-conditioned coach to a local public golf course and play some sort of themed game. The most exciting event was the three stick event. This game requires players to pick just three golf clubs out of their bag (plus a putter) to play their entire round (you can take up to 14 clubs on a normal round).\nSo which three clubs do you pick?\nThis was easy for me as I could only reliably hit two clubs: the five iron and the seven iron. I usually included a driver so as not be mocked by the septuagenarians at the par-5 tees.\nI also have an embarrassingly crap collection of golf clubs as many have been sent to an early retirement in water features.\nHowever, many friends who now play golf have a bewildering selection of exotic clubs from hybrid driving irons to 60-degree lob-wedges.\nIt seems like in there is always some new technology or method to master in data science broadly. This is interesting, but also exhausting and fills me with existential dread that I am becoming irrelevant.\nIt got me thinking, if you had to play statistics (or data science) for the rest of your career with just three algorithms/models, what would they be?"

You have no idea the shit they have to deal with every day.\nPolitical alignment: You can go into battle with some poor IT manager with a million bigger fish to fry, or you can try to influence your own manager. They are actually motivated to ensure your success and will be able to influence IT in a more effective way on your behalf.\nFind supporters: Okay sometimes you just need a favour. Find out who likes you and if they are willing to give you a hand now and then. Reward generously with coffee and thanks. Swing by their desk, ask about cricket or what flavour of Linux they are running at home.\nFind (safe) workarounds: There are areas of grey where policy meets reality. Live in those areas. IT staff are smart technologists, they exploit this grey area too. Just do it ethically. If you org has actively blocked something and have no risk appetite to do something, then don’t bypass it. Otherwise, sometimes it’s better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission.\nBuy commercially licensed software: If you go to your IT manager with arguments like: R/python is free, its open source, it wont cost anything, I can manage it myself, everyone cool on the Internet is using it, SAS/STATA are crap - then you wont get far. IT don’t care about free and open source. They want to know the software is supported so they can get help when inevitably users call them for help. They want to know the legal terms and conditions to keep legal happy. They want to ensure security vulnerabilities are patched (not by you). They want to know how it will integrate with the enterprise identity management solution. How will users be managed and authorised. They want to manage software in-line with the other billion apps they support and not by some exception because of some nerdy business user (you). Consider buying commercially licensed software like Posit Connect or Workbench. All of these problems go away and its just another piece of software. The argument then just devolves into who pays. And guess what? Everyone in a big organisation has it in their head that software licences are expensive so the sticker price won’t really surprise anyone.\n\nBonus tip: Share success: Don’t be a jerk and twist arms in other departments and get what you want then take all the credit yourself. Share success. Present to your IT team’s monthly meetings, include them in yours. Develop a ‘partnership’. They might have to be the ‘gatekeepers’ but they work for the same company because they want to make an impact too. So recognise it and appreciate it. You can’t do impactful work without them.\n\nWant to read more? Sign up to my mailing list here for weekly emails and no spam.\nLooking for a data science consultant?

When you look at the first few knights you have no information about how they rank relative to all 100. But by the time you have assessed most of the 100 knights you have information but you have no agency. The knights have all moved on and you either miss out or have to settle for whoever is left.\nThis problem comes up every time I look for a parking spot on a busy day. Do I take the first spot I find a long way from the beach? I could try to get a closer spot but may not find one and could miss out entirely. Most likely the earlier spots are now taken.\nWhen is the optimal time to stop looking and take the leap?\nThe strategy here is:\nWe assume we look at least one knight before stopping our search and assume that if we fail to find a superior knight after our looking period - we miss out! We obviously wont settle for less. (I guess I could force this to accept the last one in line - not a big deal)."

You may as well just directly install what you want and consider the VM a ‘container’.\nHowever, if you plan to make this available to other users in your organisation, or to adapt this guide for Shiny App development you may be interested in other features such as TLS/SSL security, scale up, advanced networking, continuous integration, continuous deployment, staging/production deployment slots etc. This represents a shift from development sandpit to ‘web app’. For this case, Azure App Service may be a lower hassle option. This is Microsoft’s enterprise grade, web app deployment managed service.\nIn the Virtual Machine model you are setting up compute infrastructure, deploying and running containers directly - then fiddling with the infrastructure layer for everything else. In App Service you deploy your custom docker container (here containing RStudio Server) to Azure Container Registry (kind of like DockerHub). Azure App Services then builds and serves your app from there - without you having to stand up and manage an Infra layer directly.\n\n\nCreate Azure Container Registry (ACR) (or some other Docker repository) using this help guide\nRun and test your container locally\nDeploy your local container to ACR using this help guide\nCreate a new web app in Azure App Services using this help guide\nConfiguration:\n\n\nI didn’t have to fiddle with ports, presumably it reads the exposed ports in the docker file and does this magically.\n\nFor custom environment variables like the RStudio Server password, I had to manually add this in the config section.\n\n\nand it worked just fine:"

    "text": "Binomial proportion confidence intervals are often employed when attempting to perform tests for significance, or sample size calculations around sample measurements resulting from a Bernoulli process.\nThe typical choice when calculating binomial proportion confidence intervals is the asymptotic, or normally approximated ‘Wald’ interval where success probability is measured by:\n\\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\nIn many settings, such as marketing analytics or manufacturing processes the sample proportion is close to 0 or 1. Evaluating asymptotic confidence intervals near these boundary conditions will lead to underestimation of the error, and in some cases producing an interval outside \\([0, 1]\\).\nFortunately other methods exist, such as Wilson’s score interval, exact methods and Bayesian approaches. The recommendation here is to examine the probability coverage and explore alternative methods for sample size and CI calculation, especially when the parameter is near the boundary conditions, or in cases of very small n. \n\nlibrary(binom)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nn &lt;- 50\np &lt;- c(0.01, 0.5, 0.99)\n\n\nx &lt;- purrr::map_df(p, .f =  ~binom.confint(x = n * .x, n = n, methods = 'all'))\n\n\nggplot(x, aes(colour = factor(x))) +\n  geom_point(aes(mean, method), show.legend = F) +\n  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper, y = method), show.legend = F) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept =  c(0, 1), lty = 2, col = \"grey\") +\n  facet_wrap(~(x*2/100)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"A variety of binomial confidence interval methods for p = 0.01, 0.5 & 0.99\",\n       subtitle = \"Note unusual behaviour near 0.01 and 0.99\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncov &lt;- purrr::map_df(p, ~binom.coverage(.x, n, conf.level = 0.95, method = \"all\"))\n\n\nggplot(cov, aes(colour = factor(p))) +\n  geom_point(aes(coverage, method), show.legend = F) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept =  0.95, lty = 2) +\n  facet_wrap(~(p)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Probability coverage for a variety of binomial confidence interval methods\",\n       subtitle = \"Reference line at 0.95 coverage\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA good discussion is contained in:\nWallis, Sean A.

    "title": "Integrating R with Modern Tech Stacks",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There seems to be a subconscious deterrent from using specialised tools like R as part of a production or core tech stack, as if it’s somehow not compatible with other forms of technology.\nWhich is clealy BS. Over the past year a suprising number of my projects have involved ways to package and integrate complex R code into an existing application.\nThere are many ways to do this, but few are as convincing and uncontroversial as using Docker.\nThis guide will walk through how to use Docker to bridge the gap between R and the rest of the world, enabling you to leverage R’s power while maintaining the portability, scalability, and consistency required in modern environments.\n\nWhy Combine R and Docker?\nDocker addresses these challenges by containerizing applications along with their dependencies, ensuring that they run consistently across environments. For R, this means you can create a portable, self-contained environment that includes your scripts, libraries, and configurations—all packaged in a lightweight container.\n\n\nIntegrating R with Docker in 3 steps\nIf you need to, go ahead and install Docker first.\nYou can replicate the below steps by cloning the companion Github Repository.\n\n1. Set Up Your R Environment\nBefore diving into Docker, start by setting up your R project. Ensure that:\n\nYour scripts are modular and well-organized. Below we have a basic setup where the script or code you want to run is in the app.R file.\nDependencies are explicitly listed. I suggesting using {renv}, its good practice in general but it also makes installing the required packages a lot easier later on when we write our Dockerfile.\n\nExample or a bare-minimum directory structure:\nmy-r-project/  \n│  \n├── R/              # other R scripts or function\n├── data/           # Data files (if applicable)  \n├── Dockerfile      # Docker configuration file  \n├── renv.lock       # Dependency file \n├── app.R           # Entry point  \n└── README.md       # Documentation  \n\n\n2. Write a Dockerfile for Your R Project\nThe Dockerfile defines the environment for your R application. Here’s a basic example:\n# Use the official R base image  \nFROM rocker/r-ver:4.3.1  \n\n# Install system dependencies (if needed)  \nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\  \n    libcurl4-openssl-dev \\  \n    libssl-dev \\  \n    libxml2-dev \\  \n    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  \n\n# Set the working directory  \nWORKDIR /usr/src/app  \n\n# Copy your project files  \nCOPY . .  \n\n# Install R dependencies  \nRUN Rscript -e \"install.packages('renv')\"\nRUN Rscript -e \"renv::restore()\"\n\n# Define the entry point  \nCMD [\"Rscript\", \"app.R\"]  \n\n\nKey Notes on This Dockerfile:\n\nBase Image: We use the rocker/r-ver image, which is optimized for R and maintained here.\n\nSystem Dependencies: Add system-level dependencies your R packages might require.\n\nInstall R packages: Notice how we are replying on renv’s automated package restoration?\n\n\n\n3. Build and Run the Docker Container\nBuild the container:\ndocker build -t my-r-project .  \nRun the container:\ndocker run my-r-project  \n\n\n\nAdvanced Use Cases with Docker and R\nIf you are doing serious work, you will likely want to move past cute ASCII art. In these cases you should invest a little more time into ensuring your R workflow is fit for purpose. Here are some resources to help go to the next level:\n\nIf you want an easy guide to writing better, production quality R code check out my e-book.\nIn particular, if you want to deploy a predictive model endpoint I cover this in the following case study.\nFor a simple example of deploying R as a shiny app using a base Docker image check this repo out.\nYou can even set up your own development environment using Docker. Just follow these steps.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis approach ultimately enhances collaboration between data science and engineering teams and empowers data scientists to use the tools they are most productive with, without sacrificing reliability and portability.\nFor teams looking to modernize their data science infrastructure, starting with Docker and R is a practical and transformative step.\n\nWant to read more?

Alternatively you may wish to create a custom development environment to test or replicate some other specific setup. This is a good case to move away from locally managed software to containerization, such as Docker.\nI have set up a Github repository that sets up a local data science development environment in the browser.\nIt builds a docker container including:\n\nUbuntu 20.04 LTS\nR version 4.2\nRStudio Server 2022.02.3+492\nAll tidyverse packages and devtools\ntex & publishing-related package\n\nThe image builds on the rocker/verse image from Rocker Project.\nSome other enhanced configuration options are included in the Dockerfile, such as preloading you RStudio preferences to get the same look and feel you have locally, the option to install other CRAN packages & mounting local volumes to persist your work locally.\nGo here for Step by step instructions:\nhttps://github.com/deanmarchiori/ds-env-setup"

    "title": "Data Science Workflows: CRISP-DM",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model and framework for carrying out data mining projects.\n‘Data mining’ is quite a funny term and will instantly carbon-date you if you use it. It very much of a late 90’s era. If you were around then your WFH setup probably looked like this. So good.\n\n\n\nStill room for a CD burner\n\n\nNostalgia aside, it remains a popular choice for contemporary data analysis workflows. In my practice I use a version of it for almost every project. I’m not going to bother doing a deep dive (although here is a nice overview) into each step, as honestly I don’t think any framework should be rigidly adopted, but here is the thrust of it:\n\nYou start with Business Understanding and Data Understanding as a simultaneous, iterative step. Can’t do one without the other.\nEventually you want to do some Modeling which will require Data Preparation and feature engineering etc.\nOnce you have some results you want to Evaluate they solve the business problem\nEventually you want to Deploy something.\nThere is also a ‘meta’ step of this whole thing not being just a one-shot framework and you may need to cycle through it a few times at different levels of detail.\n\n\n\n\nKenneth Jensen, CC BY-SA 3.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nI like it, but want to focus on some of the more important insights I have found in practice:\n\nYou don’t have to (and shouldn’t) do the steps in a rigid order. It’s just a framework.\nDon’t skimp on Business Understanding and Data Understanding. I know you want to start modelling straight away, just slow down cowboy.\n\nEvaluation doesnt mean model-evaluation (like ROC, AIC etc). That is done in the ‘Modelling’ step. Here it means going back to the business owner or expert and stress-testing the results to see if it solves the problem and makes real-world sense.\nA key reason I use this is to show your stakeholder that you have a process to follow. This will give everyone confidence.\nIt’s a great tool to facilitate status and project updates. i.e. We are here, and next we are moving in this direction.\n\nThat said, if you try to integrate this into waterfall or scrum project management frameworks you will find it a little unsatisfying, as it is recognised as not a real project management framework.\nFor smaller exploratory or discovery projects I tend to use these 6 phases as ‘stages’ of a project, which makes it easier to draw up a proposal and quote a job. In practice for larger projects you do need to be more iterative and cycle through 2 or three times, so be careful not to timebox each step unless you know you are just going around one time.\n\nThe deployment phase is a little tricky. It used to mean writing a paper or report. Now this is more of a full-blooded discipline in a tech sense. This is where is see the biggest modern drawback: Reconciling analysis work with product development and deployment.\n\nIn a future post I will discuss another framework on how to use CRISP-DM in the context of building and shipping something to production.\nSo should you use it? Yes. It’s great, and it’s changed my analysis projects profoundly. Rather than whipping off the curtain at the ‘results’ presentation and hear everyone in the room gulp at the same time, you manage the flow of results throughout the process so there are no surprises and its truly more collaborative.\n\nWant to read more?

See here: https://github.com/opensdmx/rsdmx. This package is extensive but not tailored for use by Pacific Statistical Agencies and experts.

This leverages the Open Source Routing Machine, based on Open Street Map data to calculate polygons that represent a given drive time from a set of coordinates. If we set this as 35-45 min drive time from the center of Sydney, we should get a ‘ring’ around Sydney containing the property location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy looking at the final frame we can see some distinguishing features in the image:\n\n\nThere is a roundabout nearby\n\nThere is a ‘Secondary Road’ (not a primary or trunk road, but more significant than roads found in villages etc)\nThere are several ‘dead-end’ roads.

We now need to manually inspect each one to match it to the tweet. As these are unsorted, the average search time to find our roundabout of interest will be \\(n/2\\) which means I have have to manually check 50 images on average. To streamline this, I wrote a function to loop through all the candidate roundabouts, and automatically export a satellite image at roughly the level of zoom that would help me identify the right frame.\n\nVideo"

    "text": "Earlier this year I was fortunate enough to work with EcoHealth Alliance on a major project focused on two WHO priority zoonoses, Rift Valley fever virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. Over a 10 year period, research teams sampled over 800 people and livestock, sampled over 300 rodents, and conducted ecological site characterizations at 150 sites in each Tanzania and South Africa.\nTo integrate data from disparate datasets we developed a novel R pipeline to standardize data cleaning, quality control and integration following reproducible science principals. This was one of the first projects of this scale that I have seen using so many tools that align to current industry best practice:\n\nVersion controlled code in Github with strict code review\nFull CI/CD automation with Github Actions\n\n{targets} as a pipeline tool\n\nR package to store and document all functions\n\n{renv} for package dependency management\n\nProper encrypted environment files for all credentials\n\nA common deterrent I hear from beginners around using tools to aid reproducibility in R code often center around the barriers to entry. They are seen as adding complexity and overhead into the process. Which they do (on small projects), but as projects become more and more complex, the benefits quickly outweigh the costs.\nAn overview of this project was given as a poster at the recent 8th World One Health Congress in Cape Town\n\n\nWant to read more?
